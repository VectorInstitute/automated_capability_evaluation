      "thought": "The user wants me to calculate the Yield to Maturity (YTM) for a specific type of bond.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**\n*   **Bond Price (Present Value, PV):** $2,000\n*   **Annual Interest Payment (Coupon, C):** $100\n*   **Maturity:** Forever. This is the critical piece of information. A bond that pays interest forever is known as a **perpetuity** or a **consol bond**.\n*   **Unknown:** Yield to Maturity (YTM).\n\n**2. Identify the Appropriate Formula:**\\nFor a standard bond with a finite maturity, calculating YTM is complex and often requires an iterative process or a financial calculator. However, for a perpetuity, the formula is very simple.\n\\nThe price (Present Value) of a perpetuity is determined by the annual coupon payment divided by the yield (or discount rate).\n\\nFormula: `PV = C / r`\n\\nWhere:\n*   `PV` is the Present Value or price of the bond.\n*   `C` is the annual coupon payment.\n*   `r` is the yield to maturity (or discount rate).\n\\nIn this problem, we are given `PV` and `C`, and we need to solve for `r`.\n\n**3. Rearrange the Formula to Solve for the Unknown (r):**\\nStarting with the formula `PV = C / r`, we can rearrange it to solve for `r`.\n\n*   Multiply both sides by `r`: `PV * r = C`\n*   Divide both sides by `PV`: `r = C / PV`\n\n**4. Substitute the Given Values into the Rearranged Formula:**\n*   `C = $100`\n*   `PV = $2,000`\n\n`r = $100 / $2,000`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation:**\\nI will perform the division to find the value of `r`.\n`r = 100 / 2000`\n`r = 1 / 20`\n`r = 0.05`\n\\nI can verify this with the Python calculator.\n```python\\ncoupon = 100\\nprice = 2000\\nyield_to_maturity = coupon / price\\nprint(yield_to_maturity)\n```\n\n**6. Convert the Result to a Percentage:**\\nThe yield is typically expressed as a percentage. To convert the decimal `0.05` to a percentage, I multiply by 100.\n\n`Percentage Yield = 0.05 * 100% = 5%`\n\n**7. Structure the Final Answer:**\\nI will first detail the step-by-step derivation, explaining the concept of a perpetuity and its formula. Then, I will show the calculation. Next, I will synthesize this into a clear, understandable explanation. Finally, I will provide the concise numerical answer.\n\\nThe final numerical answer should be the percentage value, which is 5.",
      "final_answer": "The bond described in the problem is a perpetuity because it pays a fixed coupon of $100 annually forever, with no maturity date. The value of such a bond is the present value of its infinite stream of future coupon payments.\n\\nThe formula to calculate the price (PV) of a perpetuity is `PV = C / r`, where 'C' is the annual coupon payment and 'r' is the yield to maturity (YTM). \n\\nWe are given the price (PV = $2,000) and the coupon payment (C = $100). To find the yield to maturity, we rearrange the formula to `r = C / PV`. \n\\nBy substituting the given values, we get `r = $100 / $2,000`, which equals 0.05. \n\\nFinally, to express the yield as a percentage, we multiply the decimal by 100, resulting in a yield to maturity of 5%.",
