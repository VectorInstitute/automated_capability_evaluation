This could imply that physical storage costs play a less pronounced role in gold's futures pricing compared to copper.\n   \n   - **Instability Scenario:**\n     In an instability scenario, both metals show moderate fluctuations but with more pronounced adjustments in copper compared to gold.\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- **Physical Storage Costs and Geopolitical Risks:** \n  - Copper has significantly higher physical storage costs, leading to its heightened sensitivity to spot prices.\n  - Gold shows lower physical storage costs and thus a weaker correlation between spot and futures pricing.\n  \n- **Futures Pricing Dynamics:**\n  - The differences in coefficients underscore the distinct nature of supply chain dynamics for these two metals.
