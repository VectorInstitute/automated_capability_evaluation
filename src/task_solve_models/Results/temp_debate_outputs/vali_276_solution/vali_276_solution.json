  "problem": "Question: The current price of a stock is $94, and three-month call options with a strike price of $95 currently sell for $4.70. An investor who feels that the price of the stock will increase is trying to decide between buying 100 shares and buying 2,000 call options (20 contracts). Both strategies involve an investment of $9,400.If the stock price rises to $120, what would be the profit from buying call options? (Unit: dollar)\n",
  "solution": "The calculation step must proceed by utilizing the Python code to ensure accurate computation.\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\n- **Total Initial Cost**: This is the cost to acquire the options.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Initial Cost} = 2000 \\times 4.70 = 9400\n  \\]\n\n- **Value per Option**: This is the intrinsic value assessed per option.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Value per Option} = 120 - 95 = 25\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Final Value**: The total revenue from the exercise of the options.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Final Value} = 25 \\times 2000 = 50000\n  \\]\n\n- **Net Profit**: The profit is computed by subtracting the initial cost from the total final value.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Net Profit} = 50000 - 9400 = 40600\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe investor's profit from buying the call options, given the stock price rises to $120, would be $40,600.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: $40,600\nNUMERICAL: 40600",
