  "problem": "Question: So-called same-store sales are a very important measure for companies as diverse as McDonald's and Sears. Examining same-store sales means comparing revenues from the same stores or restaurants at two different points in time.Companies focus on same-store sales because comparing total sales at two different points in time might be misleading if a company is growing by opening new stores.\n",

      "thought": "The given problem describes the concept of same-store sales, which focuses on comparing revenue from the same stores at two different points in time. This comparison aims to provide a clearer measure of a company's growth by excluding the boost caused by opening new stores. Thus, same-store sales reflect organic growth by isolating variables associated with new store openings.\n\\nTo address this problem, the critical question is whether the description and objective of this measure logically hold true based on the principles of financial analysis and consistent revenue performance evaluation.\n\\nThe explanation provided for the importance of same-store sales is logically valid as it eliminates potential misleading aspects of total sales due to the effect of opening new stores. Same-store sales focus only on pre-existing locations, allowing for a consistent baseline comparison. Therefore, logically and practically, the use of same-store sales to measure performance for companies like McDonald's and Sears is an accurate and reliable financial metric for evaluating organic growth.",

      "thought": "The user wants me to extract the solution from the provided text and format it into JSON.\n\\nThe text analyzes a description of the business metric 'same-store sales'. The core task is to determine if the description is accurate.\n\\n1.  **Step-by-step Derivation and Logical Reasoning:**\n    *   The text breaks down the problem into evaluating three claims made in the original description:\n        1.  Same-store sales is an important measure.\n        2.  The provided definition is correct.\n        3.  The reason for its importance (total sales can be misleading) is correct.\n    *   **Claims 1 & 2 (Importance and Definition):** The text confirms that the definition ('comparing revenues from the same stores... at two different points in time') is standard and that the metric is a crucial KPI in retail to assess organic growth. So, these claims are correct.\n    *   **Claim 3 (Rationale):** To verify that total sales can be misleading, the text constructs a hypothetical example of 'RetailCo'.\n        *   Year 1: 100 stores, $100M total revenue.\n        *   Year 2: Opens 20 new stores. The original 100 stores' sales decline by 10% (to $90M). The 20 new stores generate $20M. Total revenue is $110M.\n    *   **Analysis of Metrics:**\n        *   **Total Sales Growth:** ($110M - $100M) / $100M = +10%. This looks good.\n        *   **Same-Store Sales Growth:** ($90M - $100M) / $100M = -10%. This reveals an underlying problem.\n    *   **Conclusion of Derivation:** The example proves that positive total sales growth can hide negative same-store sales, making the original statement true.\n\\n2.  **Synthesized Explanation:**\n    *   This section summarizes the findings from the derivation. It reiterates that the provided text is accurate because the example clearly shows how total sales growth (+10%) can mask a decline in the core business, which is only revealed by the same-store sales metric (-10%). It concludes that all statements in the original description are factually correct.\n\\n3.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   The final, concise answer is given as 'True'.\n\n**JSON Field Mapping:**\n*   `thought`: I will use the detailed reasoning from the 'Step-by-step Derivation' and 'Synthesized Explanation' sections.\n*   `final_answer`: The 'Synthesized Explanation' serves as a good summary of the entire logical process.\n*   `answer`: The explicit final answer is 'True'.\n*   `numerical_answer`: The answer is not a number, so this will be `null`.",
      "final_answer": "The provided text accurately describes the business concept of same-store sales. The core argument is that this metric is essential because relying solely on total sales can be deceptive for companies undergoing expansion. A step-by-step analysis confirms this. By constructing a simple numerical example, we can demonstrate a scenario where a company's total sales grew by 10%, suggesting positive performance. However, the same-store sales calculation for the same period revealed a 10% decline, exposing a serious weakness in the company's existing stores. This discrepancy proves that growth from new stores can mask poor performance in the core business. Therefore, all the statements within the provided text\u2014its definition of same-store sales, its assertion of the metric's importance, and the reasoning behind it\u2014are factually correct and logically sound.",
