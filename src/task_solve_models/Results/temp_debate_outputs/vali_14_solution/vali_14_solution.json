The table provides bid and offer swap rates for different maturities. Since Company B has a loan for five years, we need to consider the swap rates for the five-year maturity. The swap rates indicate that to receive a floating rate of LIBOR, a party pays the swap rate on the fixed leg, which in this case is 6.490%. Therefore, Company B can swap its floating rate liability of LIBOR plus 75 basis points into a fixed rate liability at the 5-year swap rate of 6.490%.",

      "thought": "Company B wants to swap from a floating rate of LIBOR + 75 basis points to a fixed rate. To determine what fixed rate Company B can swap into, we need to identify the swap rate for the maturity that matches the borrowing duration of Company B. Company B is borrowing for five years; therefore, we need to consider the swap rate for five years available in the market. From the provided table, the 5-year swap rate is 6.490%. This rate represents the fixed rate that can be swapped with a floating rate that is effectively around the same level as LIBOR (without the basis points), given the market conditions. Thus, Company B can swap its floating rate of LIBOR plus 75 basis points into a 5-year fixed rate of 6.490%.",
