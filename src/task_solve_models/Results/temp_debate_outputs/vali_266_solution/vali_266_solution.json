  "problem": "Question: Portfolio A consists of a one-year zero-coupon bond with a face value of $2,000 and a 10-year zero-coupon bond with a face value of $6,000. Portfolio B consists of a 5.95-year zero-coupon bond with a face value of $5,000. The current yield on all bonds is 10% per annum.What is the value of Portfolio A when yields increase by 5%? (Unit: dollar)\n",
  "solution": "The value of Portfolio A when yields increase by 5% is calculated by finding the present value of each bond at the new yield of 15% (10% + 5%) and summing them.\n\\n1.  **Calculate the new yield:**\n    New Yield = Initial Yield + Increase = 10% + 5% = 15% or 0.15.\n\\n2.  **Calculate the Present Value (PV) of the 1-year bond:**\n    PV\u2081 = Face Value / (1 + New Yield)\u00b9\n    PV\u2081 = $2,000 / (1 + 0.15)\u00b9 = $2,000 / 1.15 = $1,739.13\n\\n3.  **Calculate the Present Value (PV) of the 10-year bond:**\n    PV\u2082 = Face Value / (1 + New Yield)\u00b9\u2070\n    PV\u2082 = $6,000 / (1 + 0.15)\u00b9\u2070 = $6,000 / 4.0455577... = $1,483.05\n\\n4.  **Calculate the total value of Portfolio A:**\n    Total Value = PV\u2081 + PV\u2082\n    Total Value = $1,739.13 + $1,483.05 = $3,222.18",
  "answer": "The value of Portfolio A when yields increase by 5% is $3222.18.",
  "numerical_answer": "3222.18",
  "reasoning": "Both agents agreed on the methodology, which is to calculate the present value of each bond at the new yield of 15% and sum the results. However, there was a minor discrepancy in the final numerical answers due to a calculation error by Agent A. Agent A calculated the present value of the 10-year bond as $1482.75, while Agent B correctly calculated it as $1483.05. Verifying the calculation confirms Agent B's value: $6,000 / (1.15)^10 \u2248 $1,483.05. Summing the correct present values ($1,739.13 + $1,483.05) yields $3,222.18. Therefore, Agent B's answer and reasoning are more accurate and are selected as the final solution.",
