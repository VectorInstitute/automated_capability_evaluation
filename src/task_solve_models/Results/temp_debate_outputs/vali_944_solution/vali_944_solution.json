  "problem": "Question: The current price of a stock is $94, and three-month call options with a strike price of $95 currently sell for $4.70. An investor who feels that the price of the stock will increase is trying to decide between buying 100 shares and buying 2,000 call options (20 contracts). Both strategies involve an investment of $9,400.At what stock price would the call option strategy be more profitable than direct stock purchase? (Unit: dollar)\n",
