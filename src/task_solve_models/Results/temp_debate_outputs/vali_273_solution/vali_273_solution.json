  "problem": "Question: In the corn futures market, different delivery months are available for trading contracts.Which one of the following corn futures contracts should be used for hedging when the expiration of the hedge is in June?\nChoices:\nA. March\nB. December\nC. July\n",
  "solution": "**Solution:**\n\nTo select the appropriate futures contract for hedging with an expiration in June, let's carefully follow the guidance plan:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Problem**\n- We need a corn futures contract to manage risk until the end of June.\n- Our aim is to maintain the hedge until and beyond June.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Fundamental Rule of Hedge Timing**\n- The futures contract should expire in June or after June to provide complete coverage.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Rule to Eliminate Invalid Choices**\n- **Choice A (March):** A March contract will expire before June, leaving us unhedged for April, May, and June.\n- **Choice B (December):** A December contract expires after June, thus providing coverage.\n- **Choice C (July):** A July contract also expires after June, thus providing coverage.\n\nAt this stage, we discard Choice A because it expires before June.\n\n**Step 4: Introduce the Principle of Minimizing Basis Risk**\n- Both Choices B (December) and C (July) expire after June. We should prefer the contract that is closest to June to minimize basis risk.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the \"Best Fit\" Rule to Select the Optimal Contract**\n- Between July and December, the July contract is closer to June. This means it will tend to more closely track the cash price of corn right after June, providing a more effective hedge.\n\nThe optimal futures contract for hedging when the expiration is in June is the July contract.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: C\nNUMERICAL: null",

      "thought": "This is a multiple-choice question. I will provide the final answer as a single letter.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Problem:**\n    *   **Objective:** To hedge a position in the corn market.\n    *   **Hedge Period:** The protection is needed until the end of June.\n    *   **Available Instruments:** Corn futures contracts with delivery months of March, December, and July.\n    *   **Task:** Select the most appropriate contract for this hedge.\n\n2.  **Establish the Fundamental Rule of Hedge Timing:**\n    The primary rule for selecting a hedging contract is that its expiration date must be **at or after** the end of the period being hedged. If the contract expires *before* the hedge period is over, the position becomes unhedged and exposed to price risk for the remaining time. In this case, the hedge is needed through June, so the chosen contract must expire in June or a later month.\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Rule to Eliminate Invalid Choices:**\n    Let's evaluate each option based on the rule that the contract must expire after June:\n    *   **A. March:** The March contract expires in March. March is *before* June. If this contract is used, the hedge will end in March, leaving the position exposed to risk for April, May, and June. Therefore, the March contract is unsuitable.\n    *   **B. December:** The December contract expires in December. December is *after* June. This contract would provide continuous coverage through the required period. Therefore, the December contract is a possible choice.\n    *   **C. July:** The July contract expires in July. July is *after* June. This contract would also provide continuous coverage through the required period. Therefore, the July contract is also a possible choice.\n\n4.  **Introduce and Apply the Principle of Minimizing Basis Risk (The \"Best Fit\" Rule):**\n    We are left with two valid options: December and July. To choose the *optimal* contract, we apply the principle of minimizing basis risk. Basis is the difference between the cash price and the futures price. This basis is most volatile for contracts far from expiration and tends to converge towards zero as the contract expires.\n    *   To create the most effective hedge with the most predictable basis, a hedger should choose the contract with the expiration date that is **closest to, but still after,** the end of the hedge period.\n    *   Comparing our two valid options:\n        *   The July contract expires one month after the end of the hedge period (June).\n        *   The December contract expires six months after the end of the hedge period (June).\n    *   The July contract's expiration is much closer to the end of the required hedge period. This proximity ensures that the futures price will more closely track the cash price of corn during June, leading to a more effective hedge and lower basis risk. The December contract, being further out, introduces more uncertainty and higher potential basis risk.\n\n### Synthesis and Conclusion:\n\nTo hedge a position through June, the futures contract must expire in June or later. This eliminates the March contract. Between the July and December contracts, the July contract is superior. It is the first available contract that expires after the hedge period, which minimizes basis risk and creates a more effective and predictable hedge.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: C\nNUMERICAL: null",
