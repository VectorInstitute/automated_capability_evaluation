      "thought": "To determine the present value of the fixed payments in the asset swap, we first need to calculate the present value of the bond's cash flows. Since the bond is selling for $90, the difference between the selling price and the calculated present value of the bond's cash flows will give the value of the asset swap. \n\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculations:**\n\\n1. **Calculate Bond Cash Flows:**\n   - The bond has a coupon rate of 5%, paid semiannually. Therefore, the semi-annual coupon payment (C) is:\n     \n     C = (5% / 2) * 100 = $2.50\n   \n   - The bond's maturity is 5 years, with twice-annual coupon payments, resulting in 10 total coupon payments.\n   - The face value (FV) of the bond is typically $100 for such calculations unless otherwise specified.\\n2. **Determine Cash Flow Schedule:**\n   - Payments: $2.50 every 6 months for 10 periods, and $100 at maturity.\n\\n3. **Calculate Present Value of Cash Flows:**\n   - Since the LIBOR/swap curve is flat at 6% with continuous compounding, we will use this rate to discount the bond's cash flows.\n   - The continuously compounded rate needs to be converted to the equivalent semi-annual effective rate, r_semi, as the cash flows occur semiannually:\n     \n     r_semi = e^(0.06/2) - 1\n     \n   - Use r_semi to discount each cash flow to present value. Layered formula for discounting:\n     \n     PV = \\( \\sum_{t = 1}^{10} \\frac{C}{(1 + r_{semi})^t} \\) + \\( \\frac{FV}{(1 + r_{semi})^{10}} \\)\n     \n   - Calculate the present value of these cash flows.\\n4. **Determine Present Value of the Asset Swap:**\n   - The present value of the fixed payments in the asset swap equals the present value of the bond cash flows minus the bond's selling price (90.00).\n\\nLet's perform these calculations to find the precise present value of the fixed payments.",
