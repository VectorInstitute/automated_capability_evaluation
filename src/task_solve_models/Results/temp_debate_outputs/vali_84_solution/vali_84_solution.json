  "solution": "To find the stated annual interest rate (APR) from an effective annual rate (EAR) of 8.6% compounded weekly, we use the formula relating the two: EAR = (1 + APR/n)^n - 1, where 'n' is the number of compounding periods. For weekly compounding, n = 52. Rearranging the formula to solve for APR gives APR = n * [(1 + EAR)^(1/n) - 1]. By substituting the given values (EAR = 0.086 and n = 52), we perform the calculation: APR = 52 * [(1 + 0.086)^(1/52) - 1]. This calculation yields an APR of approximately 0.08255. Therefore, a stated rate of 8.255% compounded weekly is equivalent to an effective annual rate of 8.6%.",

  "reasoning": "The agents did not reach a consensus on the final numerical answer. Acting as a judge, I have evaluated both solutions. Both agents correctly identified the formula EAR = (1 + APR/n)^n - 1 and the variables (EAR = 0.086, n = 52). However, Agent A made a calculation error when computing (1.086)^(1/52), leading to an incorrect final APR of 0.0858. Agent B's calculation is correct, accurately solving the rearranged formula APR = n * [(1 + EAR)^(1/n) - 1] to arrive at approximately 0.08255. Therefore, Agent B's reasoning and result are selected as the correct solution.",

      "thought": "The user wants to find the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) given an Effective Annual Rate (EAR) of 8.6% compounded weekly. The core relationship is defined by the formula EAR = (1 + APR/n)^n - 1, where EAR is the effective rate, APR is the stated rate, and n is the number of compounding periods per year. First, I need to identify the given values: EAR = 8.6% or 0.086, and the compounding frequency is weekly, which means n = 52. Next, I need to rearrange the formula to solve for APR. Adding 1 to both sides gives 1 + EAR = (1 + APR/n)^n. Taking the nth root of both sides gives (1 + EAR)^(1/n) = 1 + APR/n. Subtracting 1 gives (1 + EAR)^(1/n) - 1 = APR/n. Finally, multiplying by n isolates APR: APR = n * [(1 + EAR)^(1/n) - 1]. Now, I will substitute the known values into this rearranged formula: APR = 52 * [(1 + 0.086)^(1/52) - 1]. The calculation proceeds as follows: 1.086^(1/52) is approximately 1.0015875047. Subtracting 1 gives 0.0015875047. Multiplying by 52 yields approximately 0.0825502444. Rounding this result gives the final APR.",
