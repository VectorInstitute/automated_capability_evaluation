      "thought": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what a residual dividend policy implies. Under this policy, dividends are paid out from the residual or leftover equity after everything required to finance the capital budget has been funded. The main equations used in a residual dividend policy relate dividends to new equity needed, as calculated from earnings minus capital outlays after considering the optimal debt-equity ratio.\n\\n1. **Identify Key Data Points:**\n   - Earnings = $1,500\n   - Declared Dividends = $390\n   - Optimal Debt-Equity Ratio = 1.2\n\\n2. **Calculate the Equity Portion:**\n   The declared dividend of $390 is what's leftover after funding capital outlays with retained earnings. If we subtract dividends from earnings, the remainder is the portion of equity used for capital outlays.\n   \n   Equity Used for Capital Outlays = Earnings - Declared Dividends = $1,500 - $390 = $1,110\n\\n3. **Calculate Total Capital Outlays:**\n   Under the debt-equity ratio policy of 1.2, the debt-equity mix implies that for every $1 of equity used, there is $1.2 in debt. Therefore, the equity portion of capital expenditures is one-twelfth of the total (since:\n   \n   Equity Portion = Total Capital Outlays / (1 + Debt-Equity Ratio)\n   \n   $1,110 = X / 2.2 (because 1 + 1.2 = 2.2)\n   \n   Solving for X (Total Capital Outlays):\n   \n   Total Capital Outlays = $1,110 * 2.2 = $2,442.\n\\nThus, after identifying the relationship between the equity used and the debt support, the Total Capital Outlays are calculated to be $2,442 based on this debt-equity structure.",

      "thought": "The user wants to find the total capital outlays for Soprano, Inc. given its earnings, dividends paid, dividend policy, and optimal capital structure.\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the steps required to solve this problem:\n\\n1.  **Understand the Residual Dividend Policy:** A residual dividend policy means the company uses its earnings first to fund the equity portion of its capital expenditures. Any remaining (residual) earnings are then paid out as dividends. The formula can be expressed as:\n    `Dividends = Net Income - (Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures)`\n\\n2.  **Calculate the Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures:** We can rearrange the formula above to solve for the equity portion of capital expenditures. This portion is simply the amount of earnings that were *not* paid out as dividends, i.e., the addition to retained earnings.\n    *   Net Income = $1,500\n    *   Dividends Paid = $390\n    *   Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures = Net Income - Dividends\n    *   Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures = $1,500 - $390 = $1,110\n\\n3.  **Determine the Target Capital Structure Proportions:** The company has an optimal debt-equity ratio (D/E) of 1.20. This ratio is used to determine the proportion of any new investment (capital outlay) that should be funded by equity.\n    *   The total capital is Debt (D) + Equity (E).\n    *   The weight of equity (w_e) in the capital structure is `E / (D + E)`.\n    *   We are given `D/E = 1.20`, which means `D = 1.20 * E`.\n    *   Substitute `D` into the weight of equity formula:\n        `w_e = E / (1.20 * E + E)`\n        `w_e = E / (2.20 * E)`\n        `w_e = 1 / 2.20`\n    *   This means that for any new capital project, the company aims to finance `1 / 2.20` of it with equity.\n\\n4.  **Calculate the Total Capital Outlays:** Now we know the total dollar amount of the equity financing ($1,110) and the proportion of the total budget this amount represents (1/2.20). We can use this to find the total capital outlay.\n    *   `Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures = Total Capital Outlays * Weight of Equity (w_e)`\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for Total Capital Outlays:\n        `Total Capital Outlays = Equity Portion of Capital Expenditures / w_e`\n    *   Plug in the values:\n        `Total Capital Outlays = $1,110 / (1 / 2.20)`\n        `Total Capital Outlays = $1,110 * 2.20`\n        `Total Capital Outlays = $2,442`\n\\n5.  **Verification (optional but good practice):**\n    *   If total outlays are $2,442, the equity portion needed is `$2,442 * (1 / 2.20) = $1,110`.\n    *   The company's earnings were $1,500.\n    *   The residual available for dividends is `Earnings - Equity Portion Needed = $1,500 - $1,110 = $390`.\n    *   This matches the dividend amount given in the problem ($390), so the calculation is correct.\n\\nI will now structure these steps into the final JSON output.",
      "final_answer": "The problem is solved by working backward from the dividend payment, using the principles of the residual dividend policy. \n\\nFirst, we determine how much of the company's earnings were retained. This is calculated by subtracting the dividends paid ($390) from the total earnings ($1,500), which results in $1,110 in retained earnings. According to the residual dividend policy, this entire amount was used to fund the equity portion of new capital projects.\n\\nNext, we determine the proportion of the capital budget that is financed by equity. Given an optimal debt-equity ratio of 1.20, for every $1 of equity, there is $1.20 of debt. This means the total capital is $2.20 ($1 equity + $1.20 debt), and the weight of equity is $1 / $2.20, or 1/2.20.\n\\nFinally, since we know the dollar amount of the equity financing ($1,110) and the proportion of the total budget it represents (1/2.20), we can find the total capital outlays. By dividing the equity portion by the equity weight ($1,110 / (1/2.20)), we arrive at the total capital outlay of $2,442.",
