      "thought": "To solve for the total capital outlays using a residual dividend policy, we need to determine how much capital is available for investment after dividends are declared. The company's earnings are $1,500, and the declared dividend is $390. The earnings available for capital expenditures after dividends have been paid would therefore be the earnings minus the dividends. Additionally, given the optimal debt-equity ratio of 1.20, it implies that for every dollar of equity, $1.20 of debt is used to finance the capital outlays. We will use this ratio to determine the equity portion, and then calculate the debt proportion of the capital outlay. First, calculate the equity portion, which is the residual earnings: $1,500 - $390 = $1,110. Since the debt-equity ratio is 1.20, for every $1.00 of equity, $1.20 is debt, making the total capital investment $1.00 + $1.20 = $2.20. Therefore, using the equity portion ($1,110), the total capital outlays would be $1,110 \\times \\frac{2.20}{1.00} = $2,442.",

      "thought": "Soprano, Inc. uses a residual dividend policy, which means dividends are based on the income left over after the company funds its capital budget. The company has also provided an optimal debt-equity ratio of 1.20. Given that the earnings are $1,500 and a dividend of $390 was declared, we can calculate the total capital outlays.\n\\nFirst, calculate the retained earnings:\\nRetained Earnings = Earnings - Dividends = $1,500 - $390 = $1,110.\n\\nUnder a residual dividend policy, retained earnings are used to fund equity portions of the capital expenditures. Given the optimal debt-equity ratio of 1.20, the total capital expenditures (E) can be split into debt (D) and equity (E) as follows:\\nDebt = 1.20 \\times Equity.\n\\nFrom the equation for the debt-equity ratio, the total financing needs (T) is given by:\\nT = Equity + Debt = Equity + 1.20 \\times Equity = 2.20 \\times Equity.\n\\nSince the retained earnings provide the equity portion:\\nEquity = $1,110.\\nTotal Capital Outlays = 2.20 \\times $1,110.\n\\nNow we can compute the total capital outlays.",
