  "problem": "Question: A company's stock is selling for $4. The company has no outstanding debt. Analysts consider the liquidation value of the company to be at least $300,000, and there are 100,000 shares outstanding.What is the minimum stock price of the company's stock in liquidation? (Unit: dollar)\n",
  "solution": "### Verification and Conclusion\n\nThe code output confirms that the calculated liquidation price per share is $3. \n\nThe calculation matches our step-by-step logical deduction:\n\n1. The total liquidation value available to shareholders is $300,000.\n2. The number of shares outstanding is 100,000.\n3. Therefore, dividing the total value by the number of shares gives us the minimum price per share in a liquidation scenario, which is $3.\n\nThis aligns with our understanding of the problem and ensures that all provided conditions were correctly applied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum stock price of the company's stock in liquidation, given the provided data and conditions, is $3 per share.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 3\nNUMERICAL: 3",

The initial step-by-step breakdown correctly identifies the necessary information and formula, leading to the final calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Net Value to Shareholders:** The company's minimum liquidation value is $300,000. Since there is no debt, the entire amount is available to the shareholders.\n    *   Value to Shareholders = Total Liquidation Value - Total Debt\n    *   Value to Shareholders = $300,000 - $0 = $300,000\n\n2.  **Calculate Per-Share Value:** This net value is then divided by the number of outstanding shares to find the minimum price per share in liquidation.\n    *   Liquidation Price per Share = Value to Shareholders / Number of Shares Outstanding\n    *   Liquidation Price per Share = $300,000 / 100,000 = $3.00\n\nThe tool output of `3.0` confirms this calculation. The current stock price of $4 is extraneous information for this specific question, as it represents the market value of the company as an ongoing business, not its liquidation value.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: The minimum stock price of the company's stock in liquidation is $3.\nNUMERICAL: 3",
