  "problem": "Question: Consider a \\(5\\times 8\\) option contract for May 2009 on electricity.When monthly exercise is specified for a \\(5\\times 8\\) option contract, the holder decides once at the beginning of the month to buy electricity at the strike price for the entire month.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, let's go through the steps as outlined in the strategic plan:\n\n1. **Deconstruct and Define the Contract Specifications:**\n\n   - **Product Type:** \"5x8\" signifies a block of power delivered for 5 weekdays, each consisting of an 8-hour peak period.\n   - **Option Type:** This is a call option.\n   - **Exercise Style:** European-style, exercised for the entire month.\n   - **Delivery Period:** May 2009.\n   - **Key Variables:** We need the Strike Price (K) and the Average Spot Price (S_avg).\n\n2. **Determine the Total Contract Volume (in MWh):**\n\n   - **A. Identify Delivery Days:** May 2009 calendar days are from May 1st to May 31st.\n   - **B. Account for Holidays:** \n     - Run through May 2009 weekdays: Mondays (4, 11, 18, 25), Tuesdays (5, 12, 19, 26), Wednesdays (6, 13, 20, 27), Thursdays (7, 14, 21, 28), Fridays (1, 8, 15, 22, 29).\n     - Memorial Day, a holiday, falls on May 25, which is Monday.\n\n   - **C. Calculate Total Delivery Hours:**\n     - Total Weekdays in May = 22 (5 Fridays + 4 Mondays, minus one holiday, 5 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays)\n     - Total Hours = 21 weekdays * 8 hours = 168 hours\n\n   - **D. Calculate Total Volume (MWh):** \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Volume} = 168 \\text{ hours} \\times 1 \\text{ MW} = 168 \\text{ MWh}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Identify the Core Financial Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n   - **Payoff per Unit (per MWh):** \n     - \\( \\text{Payoff per MWh} = \\max(0, S_{\\text{avg}} - K) \\)\n   \n   - **Total Contract Payoff:**\n     - \\( \\text{Total Payoff} = \\text{Payoff per MWh} \\times 168 \\, \\text{MWh} \\)\n\n4. **Outline the Calculation Process:**\n\n   - **A. Gather Inputs:** Assume \\( K = \\$50/\\text{MWh} \\) and \\( S_{\\text{avg}} = \\$55/\\text{MWh} \\).\n   - **B. Calculate Per-Unit Payoff:** \n     - \\( \\text{Payoff per MWh} = \\max(0, 55 - 50) = \\$5/\\text{MWh} \\)\n   - **C. Calculate Total Payoff:**\n     - \\[\n     \\text{Total Payoff} = \\$5/\\text{MWh} \\times 168 \\, \\text{MWh} = \\$840\n     \\]\n\nThis makes the financial outcome based on exercising the option with the given assumptions result in a payoff of \\( \\$840 \\). If the payoff is positive, the original question asking for a boolean result depends on whether the decision to exercise initially would lead to a payoff, which here is \"True\" since \\( S_{\\text{avg}} > K \\).\n\nFINAL ANSWER: True\nNUMERICAL: 840",

The objective is to determine the validity of the statement based on the logic and definitions outlined in the guidance.\n\nThe statement to be evaluated is: \"When monthly exercise is specified for a \\(5\\times 8\\) option contract, the holder decides once at the beginning of the month to buy electricity at the strike price for the entire month.\"\n\n### **1. Deconstruct and Define the Contract Specifications**\n\nThis step requires breaking down the terms in the statement and verifying them against the definitions in the guidance.\n\n*   **Product Type (\\(5\\times 8\\)):** The statement correctly identifies the contract type. The guidance defines \"5\" as the 5 weekdays (Monday-Friday) and \"8\" as the 8 peak-load hours per day.\n*   **Option Type:** The statement describes a contract \"to buy electricity,\" which the guidance correctly identifies as a **call option**.\n*   **Exercise Style:** This is the central claim of the statement. It posits that for a \"monthly exercise\" contract, the decision is made **once at the beginning of the month** and applies to the **entire month**. The guidance, under its own \"Exercise Style\" section, directly affirms this. It quotes the problem's description and classifies it as a \"European-style exercise on a block of forward delivery, a common feature in commodity options.\" This explicitly confirms that the exercise mechanism described in the statement is a standard and well-defined industry practice.\n\nThe definitions within the statement are fully consistent with the expert guidance provided.\n\n### **2. Determine the Total Contract Volume (in MWh)**\n\nWhile the statement's validity doesn't depend on a numerical calculation, demonstrating the process for the specific contract (May 2009) shows how the single-decision framework operates. The contract covers a single, consolidated block of power, reinforcing the logic of a single exercise decision.\n\n*   **A. Identify Delivery Days:** A calendar for May 2009 shows there are 21 weekdays (Monday-Friday).\n*   **B. Account for Holidays:** A standard NERC holiday, Memorial Day, occurred on Monday, May 25, 2009. This day is excluded from the delivery period.\n    *   Number of delivery days = 21 - 1 = 20 days.\n*   **C. Calculate Total Delivery Hours:** Total Hours = 20 days \u00d7 8 hours/day = 160 hours.\n*   **D. Calculate Total Volume:** Assuming a standard 1 MW block size, Total Volume = 160 hours \u00d7 1 MW = 160 MWh.\n\nThe fact that the contract is for a single block of 160 MWh supports the logic that a single decision is made to exercise the option on this entire block.\n\n### **3. Identify the Core Financial Concepts and Formulas**\n\nThe guidance provides the standard payoff formula for a call option on an average price:\n`Total Payoff = max(0, Average Spot Price - Strike Price) * Total Volume`\n\nThe structure of this formula is contingent on the exercise style described in the statement. The use of a single `Average Spot Price (S_avg)` calculated over the entire month's delivery hours (the 160 hours) directly corresponds to a single exercise decision for the \"entire month.\" If decisions were made on a smaller basis (e.g., daily), the payoff formula would be a summation of daily payoffs, not a single calculation based on the monthly average. Therefore, the financial formula provided in the guidance presupposes the truth of the statement.\n\n### **4. Outline the Calculation Process**\n\nThe calculation process described in the guidance involves a single comparison of the average spot price to the strike price to determine the payoff for the entire contract. This single calculation is a direct result of the single-decision structure mentioned in the statement. The process is consistent with the statement.\n\n### **5. Identify Potential Pitfalls and Unit Conversions**\n\nThe guidance highlights a critical distinction under \"Decision vs. Outcome\": \"The decision to exercise is made at the start of the month based on the *expected* average price. The final financial payoff, however, is calculated at the end of the month based on the *actual* average price.\"\n\nThis point strongly supports the statement. It confirms that there is a single decision point (\"at the start of the month\") that is separate from the final settlement. This aligns perfectly with the statement's claim that \"the holder decides once at the beginning of the month...for the entire month.\"\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nEvery step of the provided strategic plan confirms the accuracy of the initial statement. The guidance explicitly identifies the described exercise style as common and standard (\"European-style exercise on a block\"). The underlying calculations for volume and payoff are structured around this single-decision framework. The statement is a correct description of how this type of electricity option contract works.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: True\nNUMERICAL: null",
