      "thought": "The investment pays $7,500 every other year, starting a year from now and continuing forever. The discount rate given is 11% compounded daily. To calculate the present value of this perpetuity that pays biennially (every two years), we need to adjust the discount rate to a biennial effective rate and apply the perpetuity formula. 1. **Convert 11% compounded daily to an effective biennial rate:** - The daily compounding factor is over a year, the effective rate (r_annual) is calculated as: \\[ r_annual = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.11}{365}\\right)^{365} - 1 \\] - For this, we calculate: \\[ 1 + \\frac{0.11}{365} = 1.00030136986 \\] \\[ \\left(1.00030136986\\right)^{365} = e^{ln(1.00030136986) \\times 365} \\] - Using \\( ln \\) approximation: \\[ ln(1.00030136986) \\approx 0.0003013 \\] \\[ e^{0.0003013 \\times 365} \\approx 1.11641199948 \\] - Therefore, the effective annual rate is approximately: \\[ r_annual = 1.11641199948 - 1 = 0.11641199948 \\] 2. **Calculate the effective biennial rate (r_biennial):** - Since biennial means every two years, the effective biennial rate is: \\[ r_biennial = \\left(1 + r_annual\\right)^2 - 1 \\] - Calculating for \\( r_biennial \\): \\[ (1 + 0.11641199948)^2 = 1.351813 \\] \\[ r_biennial = 1.351813 - 1 = 0.351813 \\] 3. **Determine the present value of the perpetuity that starts with the first payment 1 year from today:** - The formula for the present value of a perpetuity is: \\[ PV = \\frac{C}{r_biennial} \\] - C is the biennial cash flow, $7,500. - Therefore: \\[ PV = \\frac{7,500}{0.351813} \\] - This evaluates to: \\[ PV \\approx 21,324.811 \\] 4. **Account for the fact the first payment occurs after one year:** - The payment sequence is shifted by one year which means we discount the present value by one additional year's effective biennial rate. - Therefore, the adjusted PV is: \\[ PV_{adjusted} = \\frac{21,324.811}{1.11641199948} \\] - Which simplifies to: \\[ PV_{adjusted} \\approx 19,104.096 \\]",
