  "problem": "Question: You own a portfolio that is 50 percent invested in Stock X, 30 percent in Stock Y, and 20 percent in Stock Z. The expected returns on these three stocks are 10 percent, 16 percent, and 12 percent, respectively.What is the expected return on the portfolio?\n",
  "solution": "The expected return on the portfolio is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks. The formula is: E(Rp) = (Weight_X * Return_X) + (Weight_Y * Return_Y) + (Weight_Z * Return_Z). Plugging in the given values: E(Rp) = (0.50 * 10%) + (0.30 * 16%) + (0.20 * 12%) = 5.0% + 4.8% + 2.4% = 12.2%.",
  "answer": "12.2%",
  "numerical_answer": "12.2",
  "reasoning": "The agents provided different numerical answers. Agent A calculated the return as 0.124 (12.4%), while Agent B calculated it as 0.122 (12.2%). Both agents used the correct methodology of calculating a weighted average. I have verified the calculation: (0.50 * 0.10) + (0.30 * 0.16) + (0.20 * 0.12) = 0.050 + 0.048 + 0.024 = 0.122. Agent B's calculation is correct, while Agent A made an arithmetic error. As the judge, I am siding with Agent B and establishing the correct answer as 12.2%.",

The weights are given by the percentage of the portfolio invested in each stock.\n\\nLet:\n- R_x = expected return on Stock X = 10% = 0.10\n- R_y = expected return on Stock Y = 16% = 0.16\n- R_z = expected return on Stock Z = 12% = 0.12\n\\nThe weights are:\n- Weight of Stock X = 50% = 0.50\n- Weight of Stock Y = 30% = 0.30\n- Weight of Stock Z = 20% = 0.20\n\\nThe expected return of the portfolio, R_p, can be calculated using the formula:\n\\nR_p = (Weight of Stock X * R_x) + (Weight of Stock Y * R_y) + (Weight of Stock Z * R_z)\n\\nPlugging in the values, we calculate the expected return.",

This error is purely syntactic and does not impact the mathematical logic of the solution. My initial step-by-step derivation of the portfolio's expected return is correct. The expected return is the weighted average of the individual asset returns.\n\\nMy calculation was:\\nE(R_p) = (Weight_X * Return_X) + (Weight_Y * Return_Y) + (Weight_Z * Return_Z)\\nE(R_p) = (0.50 * 0.10) + (0.30 * 0.16) + (0.20 * 0.12)\\nE(R_p) = 0.050 + 0.048 + 0.024\\nE(R_p) = 0.122\n\\nConverting to a percentage, the result is 12.2%. The logic is sound, and the calculation is correct. The tool error was a distraction. I will stand by my original answer and provide a clean version of the solution. I will also provide a correctly formatted Python block for verification.",
