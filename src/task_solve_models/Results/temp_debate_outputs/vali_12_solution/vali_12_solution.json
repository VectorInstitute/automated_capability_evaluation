      "thought": "To find the total market value of Titan Mining Corporation, we need to calculate the market value for each type of security (common stock, preferred stock, and bonds) and then sum these values. 1. **Market Value of Common Stock:** - Number of common shares = 8.5 million = 8,500,000 - Market price per common share = $34 - Market value of common stock = Number of shares * Market price per share - Market value of common stock = 8,500,000 * $34 = $289,000,000 2. **Market Value of Preferred Stock:** - Number of preferred shares = 200,000 - Market price per preferred share = $83 - Market value of preferred stock = Number of shares * Market price per share - Market value of preferred stock = 200,000 * $83 = $16,600,000 3. **Market Value of Bonds:** - Number of bonds = 85,000 - Each bond par value = $1,000 - Bonds sell for 93% of par value - Market price per bond = 93% * $1,000 = 0.93 * $1,000 = $930 - Market value of bonds = Number of bonds * Market price per bond - Market value of bonds = 85,000 * $930 = $79,050,000 4. **Total Market Value of the Corporation:** - Total market value = Market value of common stock + Market value of preferred stock + Market value of bonds - Total market value = $289,000,000 + $16,600,000 + $79,050,000 - Total market value = $384,650,000 Therefore, the total market value of Titan Mining Corporation is calculated by summing up these individual market values.",
