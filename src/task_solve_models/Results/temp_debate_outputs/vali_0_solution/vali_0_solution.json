This involves starting with net income, adding back non-cash charges (such as depreciation), and accounting for changes in working capital.\n\\nStarting with net income for 2007 ($31,722) and adding back depreciation ($21,950), which is a non-cash charge, gives:\n\n- Net Income: $31,722\n- Add Depreciation: $21,950\n\\nNext, I need to account for changes in working capital accounts:\n\\n1. Change in Accounts Receivable: It increased from $12,315 to $13,865, so cash decreases by $1,550\\n2. Change in Inventory: It increased from $21,584 to $24,876, so cash decreases by $3,292\\n3. Change in Accounts Payable: It increased from $16,215 to $17,318, so cash increases by $1,103\\n4. Change in Other Current Liabilities: It increased from $11,145 to $14,451, so cash increases by $3,306\n\\nNow, I'll compute the overall change in working capital:\n- Decrease in working capital due to Accounts Receivable: -$1,550\n- Decrease in working capital due to Inventory: -$3,292\n- Increase in working capital due to Accounts Payable: +$1,103\n- Increase in working capital due to Other Liabilities: +$3,306\n\n- Total adjustment for changes in working capital = -$1,550 - $3,292 + $1,103 + $3,306 = -$433\n\\nThe net cash from operating activities = Net Income + Depreciation + Change in Working Capital\n= $31,722 + $21,950 - $433 = $54,239\n\\nTherefore, the net cash from operating activities for Smolira Golf Corp. in 2007 is $54,239.",

They start from net income and adjust it for non-cash expenses (depreciation) and changes in working capital components such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. The adjustments for working capital are individually calculated by determining the difference between 2007 and 2006 values. The calculation for net cash from operating activities is as follows: Net Cash from Operating Activities = Net Income + Depreciation + Change in Accounts Payable + Change in Other Current Liabilities - Change in Accounts Receivable - Change in Inventory. The values substituted into this equation are consistent with those provided in the balance sheet and income statement, and Scientist A correctly calculates the following: Net Cash from Operating Activities = $31,722 + $21,950 + $1,103 + $3,306 - $1,550 - $3,292 = $53,239.",
