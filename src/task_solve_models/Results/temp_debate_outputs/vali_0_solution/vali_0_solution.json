      "thought": "To determine the net cash from operating activities, we need to calculate the cash flow from operations by adjusting the net income for changes in working capital and non-cash expenses (depreciation). We'll break it down into steps:\n\\n1. **Net Income**: Identify the net income from the income statement for 2007, which is $31,722.\n\\n2. **Add back Depreciation**: Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it must be added back to net income. For 2007, depreciation is $21,950.\n\\n3. **Adjust for Changes in Working Capital**: Here, we consider changes in current assets and current liabilities except for cash. The changes will be from 2006 to 2007, and they affect the cash flow as follows:\n   - Increase in Accounts Receivable: $13,865 (2007) - $12,315 (2006) = $1,550. An increase in receivables represents a use of cash by the company.\n   - Increase in Inventory: $24,876 (2007) - $21,584 (2006) = $3,292. An increase in inventory represents a use of cash.\n   - Increase in Accounts Payable: $17,318 (2007) - $16,215 (2006) = $1,103. An increase in payables represents a source of cash.\n   - Increase in Other Current Liabilities: $14,451 (2007) - $11,145 (2006) = $3,306. This is also a source of cash.\n\\n4. **Calculation of Net Cash from Operating Activities**:\n   - Start with net income: $31,722.\n   - Add back depreciation: $31,722 + $21,950 = $53,672.\n   - Adjust for net working capital changes:\n     - Subtract increase in accounts receivable: $53,672 - $1,550 = $52,122.\n     - Subtract increase in inventory: $52,122 - $3,292 = $48,830.\n     - Add increase in accounts payable: $48,830 + $1,103 = $49,933.\n     - Add increase in other current liabilities: $49,933 + $3,306 = $53,239.\n\\nTherefore, the net cash from operating activities for Smolira Golf Corp. in 2007 is $53,239.",

      "thought": "To determine the net cash from operating activities using the indirect method, we follow the formula: CFO = Net Income + Non-Cash Charges - Change in Operating Net Working Capital. We have already identified the Net Income and Depreciation from the provided 2007 Income Statement: Net Income = $31,722 and Depreciation = $21,950.\n\\nNow we need to calculate the change in operating net working capital (NWC). This involves finding the change in current assets (excluding cash) and current liabilities.\n\\n1. Calculate the change in operating current assets:\n   - Accounts Receivable (2007) = $13,865\n   - Accounts Receivable (2006) = $12,315\n   - Inventory (2007) = $24,876\n   - Inventory (2006) = $21,584\n   - Change in current assets = (13,865 - 12,315) + (24,876 - 21,584) = $4,842\n\\n2. Calculate the change in operating current liabilities (excluding notes payable):\n   - Accounts Payable (2007) = $17,318\n   - Accounts Payable (2006) = $16,215\n   - Other (2007) = $14,451\n   - Other (2006) = $11,145\n   - Change in current liabilities = (17,318 - 16,215) + (14,451 - 11,145) = $4,409\n\\n3. Net Change in Operating Net Working Capital = Change in current assets - Change in current liabilities = $4,842 - $4,409 = $433\n\\nNow substitute these values back into our formula:\\nCFO = Net Income + Depreciation - Change in Operating NWC = $31,722 + $21,950 - $433\n\\nTherefore, Net Cash from Operating Activities = $53,239.",

The steps are as follows:\n\\n1.  **Start with Net Income:** From the 2007 income statement, the net income is $31,722.\n\\n2.  **Add back Non-Cash Expenses:** The primary non-cash expense listed is depreciation. This is added back to net income because it reduced net income without being an actual cash outflow.\n    *   Depreciation for 2007 = $21,950.\n\\n3.  **Adjust for Changes in Operating Working Capital:** We analyze the changes in current assets and current liabilities from 2006 to 2007. We exclude cash itself and financing-related items like notes payable.\n    *   **Increase in Accounts Receivable:** $13,865 - $12,315 = $1,550. An increase in accounts receivable means the company collected less cash than it recorded in sales, so this is a use of cash and must be subtracted.\n    *   **Increase in Inventory:** $24,876 - $21,584 = $3,292. An increase in inventory is a use of cash to purchase or produce more goods than were sold, so this amount is subtracted.\n    *   **Increase in Accounts Payable:** $17,318 - $16,215 = $1,103. An increase in accounts payable means the company paid its suppliers less than the cost of goods it incurred, which is a source of cash. This amount is added.\n    *   **Increase in Other Current Liabilities:** $14,451 - $11,145 = $3,306.
