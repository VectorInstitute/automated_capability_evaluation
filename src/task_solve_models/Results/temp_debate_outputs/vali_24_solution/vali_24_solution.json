Instead, we can reason through this problem without execution since it focuses on understanding the theoretical relationship between NPV, IRR, and required rates of return.\n\n### Re-refined Solution:\n\n1. **Understand Project Cash Flows:**\n   - The project has conventional cash flows (one initial outlay followed by positive cash inflows).\n\n2. **Confirm NPV Positivity:**\n   - Given that NPV > 0, this means the present value of all future cash flows exceeds the initial investment.\n\n3. **Define Required Rate of Return:**\n   - The required rate of return \\( r \\) is a discount rate used to evaluate whether an investment's expected returns meet or exceed the cost of capital.\n\n4. **Relationship Between IRR and Required Rate of Return:**\n   - For projects with positive NPV and conventional cash flows, by definition, the internal rate of return (IRR) must be greater than the required return \\( r \\). This is because the IRR is the discount rate that equates the present value of future cash inflows to the initial outlay. Since the NPV is positive, it implies that the IRR exceeds \\( r \\).\n\n5. **Pitfall Analysis:**\n   - **Non-conventional Cash Flows:** If there are non-conventional cash flows (multiple sign changes in the cash flow series), this could lead to multiple or no real IRRs, complicating the relationship between NPV and IRR.\n   - **Multiple IRRs:** In such cases, the project might not have a unique IRR, which means \\( IRR \\) could be undefined or may not equal the required rate of return.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - For projects with conventional cash flows and positive NPV, we can confidently state that the IRR must be greater than the required rate of return. The non-conventional case is a significant exception but does not invalidate the core principle under most practical scenarios in typical business contexts.\n\n### Final Answer: True\nNUMERICAL: null",
