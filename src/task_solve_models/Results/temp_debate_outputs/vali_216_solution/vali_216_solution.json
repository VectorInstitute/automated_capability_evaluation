      "thought": "To solve this problem, it's important to first understand the definitions of the options mentioned in the choices.\n\\nA. Forward Start Option: A forward start option is a type of option that is paid for at the time of purchase but does not become active until a future date. The key characteristic is that it provides the buyer the right to own an option at a specified future date at terms decided on today.\n\\nB. American Option: An American option allows the holder to exercise the option at any time before and including its expiration date.\n\\nC. Chooser Option: A chooser option allows the holder to decide whether it wants to be a call or a put at some future date.\n\n- Choice A seems to correctly define a forward start option as it emphasizes the purchase and future start aspect.\n- Choice B describes an American option, unrelated to forward start options.\n- Choice C describes chooser options, which allow the holder to choose later between a call or a put.\n\\nFrom this analysis, Choice A best describes what a forward start option is. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Choice A.",

This is a perfect fit for the 'final_answer' field in the JSON structure.

I will extract 'A' for this field.\n\\n4.  **Analyze the 'numerical_answer' section:** The answer is 'A', which is not a number. Therefore, the 'numerical_answer' should be `null`.\n\\nI will now construct the JSON object with these extracted components.",
      "final_answer": "A forward start option is a financial derivative where the investor pays the premium at the time of purchase, but the option's effective life begins at a predetermined future date. On this future \"start date,\" the strike price is typically set relative to the underlying asset's price at that moment (e.g., at-the-money). From that point until its final expiration, it functions as a standard option.\n- Choice A accurately reflects this structure: the payment is made upfront (\"paid for now\"), and the option becomes active later (\"starts at a future date\").\n- Choice B describes an American option, which is defined by its early exercise feature, not its start date.\n- Choice C describes a chooser option, which is defined by the holder's ability to select whether the option becomes a call or a put at a future date.\\nTherefore, the only correct description among the choices is A.",
