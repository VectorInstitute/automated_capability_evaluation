      "thought": "The user wants me to determine the variable cost per unit based on the provided financial data for Night Shades Inc. (NSI).\n\\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The core question is to find the \"variable cost per unit\".\n\\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Data:**\n    *   Variable materials cost per unit: $4.68\n    *   Variable labor cost per unit: $2.27\n    *   Total fixed costs: $650,000 per year\n    *   Total production: 320,000 units\n    *   Selling price per unit: $11.99\n    *   Depreciation: $190,000 per year\n\\n3.  **Define \"Variable Cost per Unit\":** Variable costs are costs that vary in total, in direct proportion to changes in the level of activity or production. The variable cost per unit is the sum of all variable costs incurred to produce a single unit.\n\\n4.  **Identify Relevant Costs:** The problem explicitly identifies two costs as variable and provides them on a per-unit basis:\n    *   Variable materials cost: $4.68 per unit. This cost scales directly with the number of units produced.\n    *   Variable labor cost: $2.27 per unit. This cost (often direct labor) also scales with production.\n\\n5.  **Identify and Exclude Irrelevant Information:** The problem includes several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the variable cost per unit. This is common in such problems to test understanding of cost concepts.\n    *   **Fixed Costs ($650,000):** By definition, these costs do not vary with the production level. They are not part of the variable cost per unit.\n    *   **Depreciation ($190,000):** Depreciation, especially when given as a lump sum for a year, is typically treated as a fixed cost. It represents the allocation of the cost of a long-term asset over time and does not change with the number of sunglasses produced in a given period.\n    *   **Total Production (320,000 units):** This information would be needed to calculate total variable cost for the year (Variable Cost per Unit * Total Production) or to allocate fixed costs on a per-unit basis, but it is not needed to determine the variable cost *per unit* itself, as the components are already given in per-unit terms.\n    *   **Selling Price ($11.99 per unit):** This is a revenue figure, not a cost. It's used for calculating profit or contribution margin, but not variable cost.\n\\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:** To find the total variable cost per unit, I simply need to sum the individual variable cost components that are provided.\n    *   Total Variable Cost per Unit = (Variable Materials Cost per Unit) + (Variable Labor Cost per Unit)\n    *   Total Variable Cost per Unit = $4.68 + $2.27\n\\n7.  **Calculate the Sum:**\n    *   4.68 + 2.27 = 6.95\n\\n8.  **Structure the Final Answer:**\n    *   Start by defining what constitutes a variable cost per unit.\n    *   Clearly identify the components of the variable cost from the problem statement.\n    *   Explain why the other financial figures (fixed costs, depreciation, selling price) are not included in this specific calculation.\n    *   Show the step-by-step addition of the variable cost components.\n    *   State the final answer clearly.",
      "final_answer": "The variable cost per unit is the sum of all costs that change directly with the production of each additional unit. In this problem, the variable costs are explicitly identified as the variable materials cost and the variable labor cost. The variable materials cost is $4.68 per unit, and the variable labor cost is $2.27 per unit. To find the total variable cost per unit, we add these two components together: $4.68 + $2.27 = $6.95. Other information provided, such as fixed costs, depreciation, selling price, and total production volume, is not relevant for calculating the variable cost per unit.",
