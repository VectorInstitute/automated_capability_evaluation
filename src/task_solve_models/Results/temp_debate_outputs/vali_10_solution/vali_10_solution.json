      "thought": "To determine the new earnings per share (EPS) after the expansion, we need to first calculate the total new number of shares issued and the subsequent new net income. Given the current share price is $50 and the new facility costs $40 million, we need to issue new shares to cover the entire cost of the new facility. \\n\\nFirst, calculate the number of new shares needed: \\nNumber of new shares = \\$40,000,000 / \\$50 = 800,000 shares.\\n\\nWith these new shares, the total number of shares post-issuance will be: \\nTotal shares = 10,000,000 + 800,000 = 10,800,000 shares.\\n\\nNext, consider the new net income with the increase from the facility: \\nNew net income = Current net income + Increase from facility = \\$18,000,000 + \\$500,000 = \\$18,500,000.\\n\\nFinally, calculate the new EPS: \\nEPS = New net income / Total number of shares = \\$18,500,000 / 10,800,000 = approximately \\$1.713.\\n\\nThis gives us the new EPS after the issuance and investment.",

      "thought": "To calculate the new earnings per share (EPS) after Teardrop Inc. issues new equity and finances the investment, we need to consider both the new shares being issued and the changes to net income. Currently, the company has 10 million shares outstanding and net income of $18 million. The current EPS is given by \\( EPS = \\frac{Net \\ Income}{Number \\ of \\ Shares} = \\frac{18,000,000}{10,000,000} = 1.8 \\). Now, Teardrop Inc. wants to raise $40 million by issuing new shares. Assuming the shares are issued at the current market price of $50, the company will issue \\( \\frac{40,000,000}{50} = 800,000 \\) new shares. Therefore, the new total number of shares after issuing would be 10,800,000. The project will increase net income by $500,000, thus the new net income would be \\( 18,000,000 + 500,000 = 18,500,000 \\). The new EPS is calculated as \\( \\frac{18,500,000}{10,800,000} \\approx 1.713 \\).",
