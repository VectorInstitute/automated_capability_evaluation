The value of reducing float is derived from the earnings potential of the capital that is made available sooner.

This additional cash can then be invested or used to reduce debt, generating a return or savings. The annual value of this is the opportunity cost of capital applied to the freed-up amount.

Assuming a 30-day month, this averages to $8,700 per day.\n2.  **Capital Freed Up**: A reduction in the collection float by 1.5 days means the firm gains access to its cash 1.5 days sooner. The amount of capital this frees up is the average daily collections multiplied by the days saved: $8,700 * 1.5 = $13,050.\n3.  **Annual Value (Willingness to Pay)**: The crucial next step is to determine the value of having this extra $13,050 available for the entire year. The value is the return the firm can earn on this capital, known as the opportunity cost of capital. While not provided in the problem, a standard assumed rate for such problems is 5%. The annual benefit is therefore: $13,050 * 0.05 = $652.50.\n\nThis annual benefit of $652.50 represents the break-even point for any service that reduces the float. The firm should be willing to pay any amount up to this value. Paying more than $652.50 would result in a net loss from the service.\n\nThe critical assumption is the 5% opportunity cost of capital. If the firm's actual opportunity cost were higher (e.g., 10%), the maximum willingness to pay would also be higher ($13,050 * 0.10 = $1,305). Conversely, a lower rate would decrease the amount.
