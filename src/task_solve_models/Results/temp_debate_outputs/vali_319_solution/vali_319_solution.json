The core approach and logical steps outlined are reasonable, but there are a few potential issues that need refinement:\n\n1. **Assumption of Risk-Free Rate**: By setting \\( r = 0 \\), it may simplify the equation but may not fully reflect real-world scenarios where interest rates play a significant role.\n2. **Volatility Consideration**: Although the implied volatilities for call and put options are different (30% vs 33%), these aren't directly utilized in solving this problem via Put-Call Parity, which is logical under assumptions of no arbitrage. However, it could provide additional context or insights if more information were available.\n3. **Spot Price Assumption**: The spot price \\( S_0 \\) should ideally be provided.
