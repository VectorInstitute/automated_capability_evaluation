  "reasoning": "There is no consensus between the agents due to a calculation error. Both agents correctly identified the formula for a continuously compounded zero-coupon bond: P = F * e^(-rt). They correctly set up the equation as 98 = 100 * e^(-r * 0.5) and rearranged it to r = -2 * ln(0.98).\n\\nAgent A made an error in the final calculation, apparently omitting the multiplication by 2, which led to an answer of approximately 2.02%. \n\\nAgent B performed the calculation correctly: r = -2 * ln(0.98) \u2248 0.040405. When converted to a percentage, this is approximately 4.04%.\n\\nAs the judge, I confirm that Agent B's reasoning and calculation are correct. The final answer is determined to be 4.04%.",
