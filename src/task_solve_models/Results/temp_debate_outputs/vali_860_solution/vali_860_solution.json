  "solution": "Based on the output, we can see that the collection of previous sales payments indeed results in an increase in the cash balance due to the timing and accrual nature of revenue recognition.\n\n### Thought\n\nThe tool execution confirms our understanding:\n- When a company records sales in a given period (e.g., Q1), those revenues are recognized in that accounting period, even if payment is not received immediately.\n- If payments for previous sales are collected later in the year (e.g., Q4), this increases the cash balance precisely because these collections are the realization of previously recorded accrued revenues.\n\nThis directly addresses our problem where \"payments for previous sales are collected,\" leading to an increase in the company's cash balance.
