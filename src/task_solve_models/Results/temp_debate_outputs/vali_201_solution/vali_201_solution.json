      "thought": "The problem requires us to calculate the change in the value of a bank's liabilities when interest rates change. The key concept here is duration, which measures the sensitivity of a bond's price (or a portfolio's value) to changes in interest rates.\n\\n1.  **Identify the relevant formula**: The approximate change in the value of a financial instrument (\u0394P) is given by the formula: \u0394P \u2248 -D \u00d7 P \u00d7 \u0394y.\n    *   \u0394P = Change in Price/Value\n    *   D = Duration (in years)\n    *   P = Initial Price/Value\n    *   \u0394y = Change in interest rate (in decimal form)\n\\n2.  **Extract the given information for liabilities**: The question is specifically about the bank's liabilities. The data for assets is not needed.\n    *   Initial value of liabilities (P) = $90 billion = $90,000,000,000.\n    *   Average duration of liabilities (D) = 6 years.\n    *   Change in interest rates (\u0394y) = a rise of 2 percentage points, which is +2% or +0.02 in decimal form.\n\\n3.  **Apply the formula**: We substitute the extracted values into the duration formula to find the change in the value of the liabilities.\n    *   \u0394P_Liabilities \u2248 -6 * $90,000,000,000 * 0.02\n\\n4.  **Perform the calculation**:\n    *   First, multiply the duration by the change in interest rate: 6 * 0.02 = 0.12.\n    *   Then, multiply this result by the initial value of the liabilities: 0.12 * $90,000,000,000 = $10,800,000,000.\n    *   Applying the negative sign from the formula, the change in value is: \u0394P_Liabilities \u2248 -$10,800,000,000.\n\\n5.  **Interpret the result**: The calculated change in value is -$10,800,000,000. The negative sign indicates that the value has decreased. The question asks, \"By how much will the bank's liabilities fall in value?\". This means we need to state the magnitude of the fall, which is the absolute value of the change.\n    *   Fall in Value = |-$10,800,000,000| = $10,800,000,000.\n\\nThe provided tool output of `-10800000000.0` confirms the calculated change in value, validating the result.",
      "final_answer": "To determine the fall in the value of the bank's liabilities, we use the concept of duration. Duration measures the price sensitivity of a portfolio to changes in interest rates. The relationship is approximated by the formula: Change in Value \u2248 -Duration \u00d7 Initial Value \u00d7 Change in Interest Rate.\n\\nIn this case, the liabilities have an initial value of $90 billion and a duration of six years. The interest rates rise by 2 percentage points (0.02).\n\\nPlugging these values into the formula:\\nChange in Value \u2248 -6 \u00d7 $90,000,000,000 \u00d7 0.02\\nChange in Value \u2248 -$10,800,000,000\n\\nThe result is a negative $10.8 billion, which indicates a decrease in the market value of the liabilities. The question asks for the amount of the fall, which is the magnitude of this change. Therefore, the bank's liabilities will fall in value by $10.8 billion.",
