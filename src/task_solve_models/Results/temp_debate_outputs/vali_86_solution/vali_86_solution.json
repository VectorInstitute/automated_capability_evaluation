      "thought": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the properties of a portfolio containing a risky and a risk-free asset.

The expected return of the portfolio can be defined as a weighted average of the expected returns of the components:\n   \\[ R_p = x \\cdot R_f + (1-x) \\cdot R_m  \\]\n   Plug in the values:\n   \\[ 0.08 = x \\cdot 0.05 + (1-x) \\cdot 0.17 \\]\n\\n2.

      "thought": "The user wants to calculate the beta of a portfolio composed of a stock and a risk-free asset. I am given the stock's beta (1.30), its expected return (17%), the risk-free rate (5%), and the portfolio's expected return (8%).\n\\nFirst, I need to determine the weights of the stock (w_stock) and the risk-free asset (w_rf) in the portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the expected returns of its assets. The formula is:\\nE(R_p) = (w_stock * E(R_stock)) + (w_rf * R_f)\n\\nI also know that the weights must sum to 1, so w_stock + w_rf = 1, which means w_rf = 1 - w_stock. The beta of the risk-free asset (\u03b2_rf) is always 0.\n\\nI can plug the given values into the expected return formula to solve for w_stock:\\n0.08 = (w_stock * 0.17) + ((1 - w_stock) * 0.05)\\n0.08 = 0.17*w_stock + 0.05 - 0.05*w_stock\\n0.08 - 0.05 = (0.17 - 0.05) * w_stock\\n0.03 = 0.12 * w_stock\\nw_stock = 0.03 / 0.12 = 0.25\n\\nSo, the weight of the stock is 25%. Consequently, the weight of the risk-free asset is w_rf = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, or 75%.\n\\nNow that I have the weights, I can calculate the portfolio's beta (\u03b2_p). The portfolio beta is the weighted average of the individual asset betas. The formula is:\\n\u03b2_p = (w_stock * \u03b2_stock) + (w_rf * \u03b2_rf)\n\\nPlugging in the weights and the given betas:\\n\u03b2_p = (0.25 * 1.30) + (0.75 * 0)\\n\u03b2_p = 0.325 + 0\\n\u03b2_p = 0.325\n\\nThe final answer is 0.325.",
      "final_answer": "To determine the portfolio's beta, we first need to find the proportion of the portfolio invested in the stock and the risk-free asset. We can deduce these proportions (weights) from the given expected returns. The portfolio's expected return of 8% is a weighted average of the stock's 17% return and the risk-free asset's 5% return. By setting up the equation 0.08 = w_stock * 0.17 + (1 - w_stock) * 0.05, we solve for the weight of the stock (w_stock), which is 0.25, or 25%. This means the remaining 75% is invested in the risk-free asset. \n\\nNext, we calculate the portfolio's beta, which is also a weighted average. Using the calculated weights and the given betas (1.30 for the stock and 0 for the risk-free asset), the portfolio beta is calculated as: \u03b2_p = (0.25 * 1.30) + (0.75 * 0). This simplifies to 0.325.",
