  "problem": "Question: Dog Up! Franks is looking at a new sausage system with an installed cost of $440,000. This cost will be depreciated straight-line to zero over the project's five-year life, at the end of which the sausage system can be scrapped for $60,000. The sausage system will save the firm $130,000 per year in pretax operating costs, and the system requires an initial investment in net working capital of $34,000. The tax rate is 34 percent and the discount rate is 10 percent.What is the after-tax salvage value of the sausage system? (Unit: dollar)\n",
