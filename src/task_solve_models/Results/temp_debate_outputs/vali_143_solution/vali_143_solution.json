  "problem": "Question: Brewer Industries had the following operating results for 2007: sales were $15,200, cost of goods sold was $11,400, depreciation expense was $2,700, interest expense was $520, and dividends paid were $600. At the beginning of the year, net fixed assets were $9,100, current assets were $3,200, and current liabilities were $1,800. At the end of the year, net fixed assets were $9,700, current assets were $3,850, and current liabilities were $2,100. The tax rate for 2007 was 34 percent.What was the operating cash flow for Brewer Industries in 2007? (Unit: dollar)\n",
