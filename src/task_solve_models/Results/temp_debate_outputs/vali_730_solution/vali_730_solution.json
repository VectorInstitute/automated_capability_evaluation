  "problem": "Question: The YTM on a bond is the interest rate you earn on your investment if interest rates don't change. If you actually sell the bond before it matures, your realized return is known as the _holding period yield (HPY)_. Suppose that today you buy an 8 percent annual coupon bond for $1,105. The bond has 10 years to maturity. Two years from now, the YTM on your bond has declined by 1 percent.What is the HPY on your investment if you sell the bond two years from now? (Unit: percent)\n",

However, I suspect a potential oversight in their calculation of the bond price at maturity (P2), as they assumed a YTM without recalculating it specifically for the remaining time.\n\n2. **Scientist C's Approach**: Scientist C performed a detailed step-by-step manual recalculation, which included discounting each cash flow to its present value individually. This approach is thorough and likely more accurate in avoiding any oversights related to assumptions about YTM during intermediate steps. However, it seems there might be an error in the summation of PV values or interpreting the bond price.\n\n### Detailed Calculations\n\nLet's follow Scientist C's method precisely:\n\n1. **Calculate Annual Coupon Payments**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total coupon income over 2 years} = 2 \\times \\$80 = \\$160\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Bond\u2019s Value at the End of Two Years (Redemption Value)**:\n   - The remaining maturity is \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) years.\n   \n3. **Present Value Calculation**:\n\n\\[\nPV_{\\text{coupons}} = \\sum_{t=2}^{9} \\frac{80}{(1 + 0.09)^{t+2}}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute each \\( PV_t \\) individually:\n\n- For \\( t = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_3 = \\frac{80}{1.09^5} = \\$54.65\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_4 = \\frac{80}{1.09^6} = \\$49.87\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_5 = \\frac{80}{1.09^7} = \\$45.32\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_6 = \\frac{80}{1.09^8} = \\$41.00\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_7 = \\frac{80}{1.09^9} = \\$37.00\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 7 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_8 = \\frac{80}{1.09^{10}} = \\$33.25\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( t = 8 \\):\n  \\[\n  PV_9 = \\frac{80}{1.09^{11}} = \\$30.00\n  \\]\n\nSumming these up:\n\\[\nPV_{\\text{coupons}} = 54.65 + 49.87 + 45.32 + 41.00 + 37.00 + 33.25 + 30.00 = \\$301.09\n\\]\n\nFor the principal:\n\\[\nPV_{\\text{principal}} = \\frac{1000}{(1 + 0.09)^{8}} = \\$422.41\n\\]\n\nTotal Present Value at the end of two years (P2):\n\\[\n\\text{Total PV} = PV_{\\text{coupons}} + PV_{\\text{principal}} = 301.09 + 422.41 = \\$723.50\n\\]\n\n### Capital Gain or Loss\n\n- Current bond price: \\( P_0 = 1105 \\)\n- Bond's value at the end of two years: \\( P_2 = 968 \\)\n\nCapital gain or loss:\n\\[\nP_2 - P_0 = 968 - 1105 = -\\$137\n\\]\n\n### Total Return\n\n- Coupon income over two years: \\$160 (as calculated earlier)\n- Net capital gain/loss: -\\$137\n\nTotal return:\n\\[\n160 - 137 = \\$23\n\\]\n\n### HPY Calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{HPY} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total Return}}{\\text{Initial Investment}}\\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{HPY} = \\left(\\frac{23}{1105}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 2.08\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**Final Answer**: No\n**Numerical Answer**: 2.08\n\nThus, the HPY on your investment if you sell the bond two years from now is \\(2.08\\%\\).\n\n---\n\nFINAL ANSWER: No\nNUMERICAL: 2.08",
