  "problem": "Question: Consider a project with a required return of \\(R\\%\\) that costs \\(S\\) and will last for \\(N\\) years. The project uses straight-line depreciation to zero over the \\(N\\)-year life; there is no salvage value or net working capital requirements.At the financial breakeven level of output, the IRR of the project is equal to the required return.\n",
  "solution": "### Thought\n\nThe Moderator's proposed strategy is well-structured and theoretically sound. It correctly identifies that at financial breakeven, the NPV should be zero, and it accounts for straight-line depreciation, which reduces net income.\n\n1. **Strategy Weighting**:\n   - The approach is logical and detailed.\n   - It correctly uses key financial concepts such as NPV, IRR, and straight-line depreciation.\n   - There are no obvious logic gaps or missed steps.\n\n2. **Refinement**: \n\n- The only potential refinement could be ensuring that all terms in the final equation are consistently defined and that unit conversions are explicitly verified to avoid any inconsistencies.
