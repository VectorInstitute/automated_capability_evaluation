  "reasoning": "Consensus was not reached as the agents' numerical answers ($41,313.68 and $39,476.46) differ by more than 1%. As this is the final round, a judging decision is required. Both agents correctly identified the problem as a future value calculation and used the correct formula: FV = PV * (1 + r)^n. They also correctly identified the inputs: PV = $25,000, r = 0.079, and n = 6. However, both agents made arithmetic errors during calculation. As the judge, I have re-executed the calculation using their sound methodology: FV = 25,000 * (1.079)^6 = $39,304.67. This corrected value is the final answer.",
