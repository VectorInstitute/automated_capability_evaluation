      "reasoning": "The core of this question revolves around the mechanics of futures contracts, specifically the daily settlement or 'mark-to-market' process. \n1. When an entity enters into a futures contract, they must post an initial margin. Their account is then adjusted daily based on the price movement of the contract.\n2. If the price moves against the hedger's position (e.g., the price rises for a short hedge, or falls for a long hedge), their margin account will lose money.\n3. If these losses cause the margin account balance to fall below a predetermined 'maintenance margin' level, the broker will issue a 'margin call'.\n4. A margin call is a demand for the hedger to deposit additional funds (variation margin) to bring the account back up to the initial margin level. This represents an immediate and often unpredictable cash outflow.\n5. This can create a significant cash flow problem because even if the overall hedge is effective (i.e., the loss on the futures contract is being offset by a gain in the value of the underlying physical asset), the gain on the physical asset is not realized until a later date. The hedger must find cash *now* to meet the margin call, leading to a potential liquidity squeeze.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\nA. Predictable cash inflows are the opposite of a cash flow problem. They are beneficial and easy to plan for.\nB. Margin calls creating cash outflows directly describes the mechanism that causes the liquidity strain. An adverse price movement in the futures market triggers a demand for immediate cash, which is the essence of the cash flow problem.\nC. Immediate profit realization means the futures position is making money, resulting in cash inflows to the margin account. This is a cash flow benefit, not a problem.",

Systematic risk, also known as market risk, is inherent to the entire market and cannot be diversified away (e.g., risks from recessions, interest rate changes). Unsystematic risk, also known as specific or idiosyncratic risk, is unique to an individual company or industry (e.g., a lawsuit, a new patent, management changes). Diversification, the process of investing in a variety of assets, works because the specific risks of different companies are not perfectly correlated. The negative performance of one stock due to a company-specific event can be offset by the positive performance of another. By creating a portfolio of stocks, like a stock index, an investor can effectively eliminate most of the unsystematic risk. This leaves primarily systematic risk. Consequently, the volatility (a common measure of risk) of a diversified portfolio like a stock index is almost always lower than the volatility of a typical individual stock. The statement accurately concludes that diversification reduces 'some risk' (the unsystematic portion) associated with return uncertainty.",

      "reasoning": "1.  A downward sloping term structure of interest rates (also known as an inverted yield curve) means that short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates. For the zero-coupon yield curve, this implies that the 1-year zero rate is greater than the 2-year zero rate, which is greater than the 3-year zero rate, and so on. Specifically for a five-year period: z1 > z2 > z3 > z4 > z5, where z(t) is the t-year zero rate.\n2.  A five-year coupon-bearing bond provides multiple cash flows: a coupon payment at the end of year 1, year 2, year 3, year 4, and a final coupon plus principal at the end of year 5.\n3.  The yield to maturity (YTM) of a coupon-bearing bond is a single discount rate that equates the present value of all its future cash flows to its current market price. It can be viewed as a complex weighted average of the zero rates corresponding to each cash flow's timing.\n4.  The bond's cash flows at years 1, 2, 3, and 4 are subject to higher short-term and medium-term zero rates (z1, z2, z3, z4), while only the final cash flow at year 5 is subject to the lower 5-year zero rate (z5).\n5.  Because the YTM is an average of the rates used to discount all cash flows, and most of these rates (z1 through z4) are higher than the final rate (z5), the resulting YTM will be pulled up by these higher short-term rates. \n6.  Therefore, the yield on the five-year coupon-bearing bond will be higher than the five-year zero rate (z5) but lower than the one-year zero rate (z1). The relationship is z1 > YTM > z5.\n7.

The formula relating these is: Ending Net Fixed Assets = Beginning Net Fixed Assets + Capital Expenditures - Depreciation.\n3.  We can rearrange this formula to solve for Capital Expenditures, which represents the cash outflow for purchasing new assets: Capital Expenditures = (Ending Net Fixed Assets - Beginning Net Fixed Assets) + Depreciation.\n4.  From the balance sheets, we find the beginning and ending values for Net plant and equipment:\n    -   Beginning Net Fixed Assets (2006) = $168,326\n    -   Ending Net Fixed Assets (2007) = $184,735\n5.
