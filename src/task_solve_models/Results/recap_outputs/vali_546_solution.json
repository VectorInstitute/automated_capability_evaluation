      "chosen_evidence": "All three candidates agree on the logic and the final choice. Candidate C is slightly clearer and explicitly verifies all required checks: (1) Fed lending adds $100 million to reserves, (2) a $50 million withdrawal reduces reserves by $50 million, (3) the net change is +$50 million, and (4) this matches option A. No extraneous balance-sheet changes are assumed, and amounts are consistently in millions of dollars."
