If, at that time, the euro has strengthened (the spot USD/EUR rate is higher than the contracted forward rate), the company effectively gains on the forward: it acquires the required euros more cheaply than it would on the spot market, offsetting what would otherwise be a higher USD cost of its EUR payable. Conversely, if the euro has weakened (the spot USD/EUR rate is lower than the forward rate), the company incurs a loss on the forward: it pays more USD for the euros than the then-current spot cost, but this higher cost is offset by the fact that its underlying EUR liability has become cheaper in USD terms.

      "chosen_result": "Conceptually, this forward contract is an appropriate hedge: it matches the size (3 million EUR), timing (three months), and direction (buying EUR) of the company’s known EUR liability, thereby converting an uncertain future USD cost into a known fixed USD outflow and neutralizing the risk of EUR appreciation against USD, while sacrificing potential gains from EUR depreciation.",
      "chosen_evidence": "Candidate C clearly ties the hedge’s appropriateness to all key dimensions—amount, timing, and direction—explicitly referencing how it stabilizes USD cash flows and neutralizes EUR appreciation risk. The explanation is concise, fully aligned with prior steps (S4–S8), and accurately reflects standard textbook reasoning about hedging a foreign-currency payable with a matching forward contract. It is slightly more complete and structured than A and B while remaining clear and on task."
