A typical fixed‑strike Asian call has payoff max(A_T − K, 0), so at any time t before maturity, its value is V(t, S_t, A_t) (or V(t, S_t, G_t)), where A_t is the running/partial average built from past observations. Because past prices are locked into A_t and cannot be changed, only the remaining part of the averaging window is affected by changes in current spot S_t. Thus the option’s delta ∂V/∂S_t reflects how today’s spot move influences the future completed average, which generally gives a smoother, less extreme sensitivity than a vanilla option whose payoff depends only on S_T. Near maturity, if most of the average is already fixed, the impact of S_t on the final average is proportionally smaller (since only the last few observations are left), so the delta is driven by how much of the averaging period is still ‘unfixed’ and by whether the almost‑completed average is in, at, or out of the money. This path dependence implies that delta depends jointly on current spot and the accumulated average: two states with the same S_t but different A_t can have very different deltas, and even very close to maturity the delta does not behave like a simple function of S_t alone, unlike for vanilla options."

For a fixed‑strike Asian call with arithmetic average, the payoff is max(A_T − K, 0) where A_T is the (discrete or continuous) time‑average of S over [0, T] or over a monitoring grid. Similarly, for a put it is max(K − A_T, 0). Geometric‑average Asians replace the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of observed prices. Because the payoff depends on this running average, the option value at time t can be written as V(t, S_t, A_t), where A_t summarizes the price history up to t. The delta is then ∂V/∂S_t holding A_t fixed, but future increments of A (from t to T) still depend on future S, so a change in S_t affects not only the current intrinsic component but also the expected evolution of A_T. Early in the life of the option, when many observation dates remain, each spot move has a smaller effect on the eventual average (dA_T/dS_t is diluted by the length of the averaging window), so the delta tends to be smoother and less extreme than for a comparable vanilla. As maturity approaches, a larger fraction of the average is already fixed (past observations), and only the remaining few observations are still sensitive to spot; this reduces the marginal impact of current spot on A_T but does not remove it unless all averaging dates are already fixed. Therefore, near maturity, the Asian option’s value can remain sensitive both to the current S_t and to the path‑encoded A_t, and its delta reflects this dual dependence. This path dependence generally yields deltas that are less “binary” than vanilla deltas at expiry and require hedgers to consider both the remaining averaging period and the already‑locked‑in part of the average when interpreting and managing delta, especially close to maturity.",

      "chosen_worker_id": "C",
      "chosen_result": "Consistency check passed; final internal decision remains: true",
      "chosen_evidence": "Candidate C clearly states that the consistency check has passed and explicitly confirms the internal decision as true, while tying this back to prior conclusions about Asian options’ path-dependent, generally non-vanishing deltas and increased hedging complexity. The reasoning is concise, aligned with standard derivatives theory, and free of contradictions or unnecessary assumptions, making it the strongest and clearest of the three similar candidates."
