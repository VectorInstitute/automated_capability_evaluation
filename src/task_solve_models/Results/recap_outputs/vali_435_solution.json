  "answer": "Liquidity is a firm’s ability to meet short-term obligations with cash and assets that can quickly be converted to cash. High liquidity provides safety but ties up funds in low-return assets, while low liquidity can raise profitability but increases the risk of cash shortages and financial distress. It is therefore the responsibility of the firm’s financial management to choose a reasonable compromise liquidity level that balances this safety–profitability trade-off.",

The response is concise and conceptual, suitable for a bool-style evaluation, and contains no unnecessary numerical detail, in line with the task requirements.",
