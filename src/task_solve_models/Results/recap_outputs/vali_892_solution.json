A ‘downward-sloping’ term structure means that r(T) decreases as T increases: longer maturities have lower spot rates than shorter ones.\n\\n2) Yield to maturity of a coupon-bearing bond: The yield to maturity (YTM) on a coupon bond is the single constant rate y that, when used to discount all the bond’s promised cash flows (coupons and principal), equates their present value to the bond’s price. It is therefore a kind of average internal rate of return over the life of the bond, reflecting discounting at one flat rate instead of the full term structure of spot rates.\n\\n3) Forward rate for 4.75–5 years: The forward rate f(4.75,5) is the annualized interest rate, agreed today, for borrowing/lending during the future interval from 4.75 years to 5.0 years. Under no-arbitrage, it is implied by the spot discount factors (or spot rates) out to 4.75 and 5 years: it is the single rate over that short future period that makes rolling investment to 4.75 and then at the forward rate to 5 equivalent to investing directly to 5 at the 5-year spot rate.\n\\n4) Qualitative relation under a downward-sloping curve: When the term structure is downward sloping, later-dated spot rates are lower than earlier ones, and the sequence of forward rates across time typically declines as maturity increases. A long-horizon yield to maturity (e.g., a 5-year yield) on a coupon bond is a weighted average of discount rates over 0–5 years. In a downward-sloping curve, that average will generally lie between the higher short-term rates (near today) and the lower long-term/terminal rates (e.g., forward rates close to year 5). Thus, terminal forward rates near the end of the horizon (like the 4.75–5 year forward) will usually be lower than the earlier short rates and can be below the multi-year average yield represented by the bond’s YTM.",
