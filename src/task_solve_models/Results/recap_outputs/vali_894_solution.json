  "reasoning": "Using the three-step CRR binomial model with Δt = 0.25, u = 1.1311139, d = 0.8840774, risk-neutral probability p = 0.5264419, and per-step discount factor df = e^(−0.03×0.25) ≈ 0.9925281, we first built the futures price tree and computed terminal payoffs of the American put on futures at T: max(50 − F(3,j), 0). These terminal payoffs are approximately [15.45, 5.80, 0, 0].\n\\nBackward induction with early exercise:\n- At step 2, continuation values are compared with immediate exercise values max(50 − F(2,j), 0), yielding V(2,0) ≈ 11.46, V(2,1) ≈ 4.15, V(2,2) = 0; continuation is always preferred at this step.\n- At step 1, comparing continuation values with immediate exercise values max(50 − F(1,j), 0) gives V(1,0) ≈ 8.36, V(1,1) ≈ 2.77; again, continuation dominates early exercise.\n- At step 0, the immediate exercise value is 0 (since F0 = K), while the continuation value is df × [p V(1,1) + (1−p) V(1,0)] ≈ 3.62, so the American put’s value is V(0,0) ≈ 3.62.\n\\nThus, the value of the American put futures option using the specified three-step tree is 3.62 dollars.",
