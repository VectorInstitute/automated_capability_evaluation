  "reasoning": "Using the monthly framework (180 payments of $1,500), the first 84 payments are discounted at i1 = 0.13/12 ≈ 0.01083333, giving PV_segment1_at_time0 ≈ 116,666.37. The remaining 96 payments are first valued at the end of month 84 as an ordinary annuity at i2 = 0.10/12 ≈ 0.00833333, giving PV_segment2_at_boundary ≈ 123,018.23. This boundary value is then discounted 84 months at i1: PV_segment2_at_time0 ≈ 123,018.23 / (1 + 0.01083333)^84 ≈ 72,789.17. Summing the two present values yields PV_total_at_time0 ≈ 116,666.37 + 72,789.17 = 189,455.54, which is well below the total nominal payments (180 × 1,500 = 270,000), as expected given positive interest rates.",

The first interest-rate regime applies for the first 7 years, which is 84 months; during these months, the nominal annual rate is 13% compounded monthly, corresponding to a monthly rate of 13%/12. The second interest-rate regime applies for the remaining 8 years, which is 96 months; during these months, the nominal annual rate is 10% compounded monthly, corresponding to a monthly rate of 10%/12. Payments 1 through 84 fall in the first-rate period (discounted using the 13%/12 monthly rate), and payments 85 through 180 fall in the second-rate period (valued using the 10%/12 monthly rate and then discounted back to time 0 through the 84-month boundary).",
      "chosen_evidence": "Candidate C clearly restates all required data in monthly terms: total months/payments (180), segmentation into 7 years (84 months) and 8 years (96 months), identifies payment indices in each period (1–84 and 85–180), and ties each segment to its appropriate nominal rate and implied monthly rate expression. It also explicitly mentions how the second-period payments will be valued at their own rate and then discounted back through the 84-month boundary, which aligns well with the later planned steps. All three candidates are essentially correct; C is slightly more complete in connecting the second segment to the discounting boundary."
