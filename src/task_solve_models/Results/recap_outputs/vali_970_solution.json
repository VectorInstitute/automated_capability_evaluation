  "reasoning": "Using the 15% sales increase, projected sales are 36,800 (Steps S4/S4_calc). With all costs assumed variable, projected costs are 14,835 (Steps S5–S6/S6_calc), so projected taxable income is 21,965 (Steps S7/S7_calc). Applying the 34% tax rate yields taxes of 21,965 × 0.34 = 7,468.10 (S8), leaving projected net income of 21,965 − 7,468.10 = 14,496.90 (S9). The original payout ratio is 4,800 ÷ 12,606 ≈ 0.3808769 (Steps S2/S2_calc), so projected dividends are 14,496.90 × 0.3808769 ≈ 5,490.28 (S10). The projected addition to retained earnings is then 14,496.90 − 5,490.28 ≈ 11,006.62 (S11). As a check, dividends plus retained earnings equals projected net income and the payout ratio is preserved (S12).",
