  "numerical_answer": "3426",
  "reasoning": "Using the standard OCF formula OCF = EBIT × (1 − Tax rate) + Depreciation: from steps S4/S4_calc, EBIT = 15200 − 11400 − 2700 = 1100. From S5/S5_calc, tax rate = 0.34. Taxes on EBIT (S6/S6_calc) are 1100 × 0.34 = 374, so after-tax EBIT (S7/S7_calc) is 1100 − 374 = 726. Adding back depreciation (2700) in S8 gives OCF = 726 + 2700 = 3426 dollars. Interest, dividends, and balance sheet figures are excluded as they are financing or non-OCF items.",
