An investor who feels that the price of the stock will increase is trying to decide between buying 100 shares and buying 2,000 call options (20 contracts).

  "reasoning": "From the completed steps, both strategies cost $9,400 initially. The profit from buying 100 shares at future price S is profit_stock(S) = 100S − 9,400. For 2,000 calls with strike $95 and premium $4.70, for S ≥ 95 the profit is profit_calls(S) = 2,000(S − 95) − 9,400. Setting these equal for the breakeven point gives 2,000(S − 95) − 9,400 = 100S − 9,400, which simplifies to 1,900S − 190,000 = 0, yielding S = 100. Above this price, the much steeper slope of the call-profit function (2,000 vs 100) makes the call strategy more profitable. Thus, the threshold stock price is $100.",
