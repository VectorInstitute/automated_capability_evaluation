Their reasoning is consistent with the earlier steps: (A) a decrease in the risk-free rate reduces the benefit of receiving the strike early, making early exercise less attractive; (B) an increase in the insurance/time-value element also makes early exercise less attractive because more value would be forfeited; (C) a decrease in volatility reduces time value, so there is less to lose by exercising now, increasing the attractiveness of early exercise. Candidate C states this clearly and concisely with correct theoretical backing."
