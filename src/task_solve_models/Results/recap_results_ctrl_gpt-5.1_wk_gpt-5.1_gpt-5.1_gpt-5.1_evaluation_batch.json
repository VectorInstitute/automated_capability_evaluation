Here, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years correspond to the midpoints of each year (1–5). This reflects the standard assumption that, on average, defaults in a given year occur halfway through that year.\n\n- Probability of default: For each year, this is the unconditional probability that default occurs during that specific year (from the default probability table). It represents the chance that the accrual payment for that year will actually be triggered.\n\n- Expected accrual payment: This is the expected amount of premium accrued by the time of default within that year, per unit CDS spread s. With annual payments and a mid-year default assumption, the accrued coupon is roughly half of the annual spread (about 0.5·s), adjusted slightly year by year to reflect more precise survival/default assumptions (hence 0.0099s, 0.0097s, etc., instead of exactly 0.5·0.01 = 0.005 when s = 0.01).\n\n- Discount factor: The present value factor for cash flows received at that midpoint time. It reflects discounting for the risk-free interest rate from today to the accrual payment date.\n\n- PV of expected accrual payment: The expected accrual payment for that year multiplied by the corresponding discount factor. This yields the present value, per unit spread s, of the accrual premium associated with defaults in that year.\n\\nSumming the PV of expected accrual payments across all five years gives the total present value of the accrual component of the premium leg:\n\\nPV_accrual = 0.0422 · s.\n\\nThus, for a given spread s, the premium leg’s full PV equals the sum of (i) the PV of the regular coupon payments at each annual date and (ii) this accrual component 0.0422·s.

This reflects the standard assumption that, on average, defaults in a given year occur halfway through that year.\n\n- Probability of default: For each year, this is the unconditional probability that default occurs during that specific year (from the default probability table). It represents the chance that the accrual payment for that year will actually be triggered.\n\n- Expected accrual payment: This is the expected amount of premium accrued by the time of default within that year, per unit CDS spread s. With annual payments and a mid-year default assumption, the accrued coupon is roughly half of the annual spread (about 0.5·s), adjusted slightly year by year to reflect more precise survival/default assumptions (hence 0.0099s, 0.0097s, etc., instead of exactly 0.5·0.01 = 0.005 when s = 0.01).\n\n- Discount factor: The present value factor for cash flows received at that midpoint time. It reflects discounting for the risk-free interest rate from today to the accrual payment date.\n\n- PV of expected accrual payment: The expected accrual payment for that year multiplied by the corresponding discount factor. This yields the present value, per unit spread s, of the accrual premium associated with defaults in that year.\n\\nSumming the PV of expected accrual payments across all five years gives the total present value of the accrual component of the premium leg:\n\\nPV_accrual = 0.0422 · s.\n\\nThus, for a given spread s, the premium leg’s full PV equals the sum of (i) the PV of the regular coupon payments at each annual date and (ii) this accrual component 0.0422·s. The 0.0422·s term specifically quantifies how much extra value comes from the obligation to pay accrued premium upon default over the life of the 5-year CDS.",

(2) Volatility: Higher volatility increases the option’s time value/insurance value, because there is more chance the stock price will move further in-the-money; this makes waiting more valuable and early exercise less attractive. Conversely, lower volatility reduces time value and thus makes early exercise relatively more attractive. (3) Time value / insurance component: The larger the time value (insurance element) relative to intrinsic value, the more valuable it is to continue holding the option (not exercise early); when the time value shrinks (insurance element decreases), the incentive to exercise early increases because there is less to lose by giving up future optionality.",

Delta hedging: A dynamic hedging strategy that continuously (or discretely) adjusts the position in the underlying asset to offset small changes in the option’s value with respect to changes in the underlying price (i.e., hedge using the option’s delta, ∂V/∂S). Modeling context: Assume a standard continuous-time, no-arbitrage, risk-neutral framework with a diffusion process for the underlying (e.g., geometric Brownian motion), frictionless markets, continuous trading, and perfect divisibility of the asset. For regular options, pricing and hedging follow Black–Scholes-style spot-based payoffs; for Asian options, pricing and hedging must account for path dependence via the running average, so the option value V(t, S_t, A_t) depends on both current spot and the accumulated average, and the delta is ∂V/∂S_t under this multi-state-variable setup."

A typical fixed‑strike Asian call has payoff max(A_T − K, 0), so at any time t before maturity, its value is V(t, S_t, A_t) (or V(t, S_t, G_t)), where A_t is the running/partial average built from past observations. Because past prices are locked into A_t and cannot be changed, only the remaining part of the averaging window is affected by changes in current spot S_t. Thus the option’s delta ∂V/∂S_t reflects how today’s spot move influences the future completed average, which generally gives a smoother, less extreme sensitivity than a vanilla option whose payoff depends only on S_T. Near maturity, if most of the average is already fixed, the impact of S_t on the final average is proportionally smaller (since only the last few observations are left), so the delta is driven by how much of the averaging period is still ‘unfixed’ and by whether the almost‑completed average is in, at, or out of the money. This path dependence implies that delta depends jointly on current spot and the accumulated average: two states with the same S_t but different A_t can have very different deltas, and even very close to maturity the delta does not behave like a simple function of S_t alone, unlike for vanilla options."

For a fixed‑strike Asian call with arithmetic average, the payoff is max(A_T − K, 0) where A_T is the (discrete or continuous) time‑average of S over [0, T] or over a monitoring grid. Similarly, for a put it is max(K − A_T, 0). Geometric‑average Asians replace the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of observed prices. Because the payoff depends on this running average, the option value at time t can be written as V(t, S_t, A_t), where A_t summarizes the price history up to t. The delta is then ∂V/∂S_t holding A_t fixed, but future increments of A (from t to T) still depend on future S, so a change in S_t affects not only the current intrinsic component but also the expected evolution of A_T. Early in the life of the option, when many observation dates remain, each spot move has a smaller effect on the eventual average (dA_T/dS_t is diluted by the length of the averaging window), so the delta tends to be smoother and less extreme than for a comparable vanilla. As maturity approaches, a larger fraction of the average is already fixed (past observations), and only the remaining few observations are still sensitive to spot; this reduces the marginal impact of current spot on A_T but does not remove it unless all averaging dates are already fixed. Therefore, near maturity, the Asian option’s value can remain sensitive both to the current S_t and to the path‑encoded A_t, and its delta reflects this dual dependence. This path dependence generally yields deltas that are less “binary” than vanilla deltas at expiry and require hedgers to consider both the remaining averaging period and the already‑locked‑in part of the average when interpreting and managing delta, especially close to maturity.",

A ‘downward-sloping’ term structure means that r(T) decreases as T increases: longer maturities have lower spot rates than shorter ones.\n\\n2) Yield to maturity of a coupon-bearing bond: The yield to maturity (YTM) on a coupon bond is the single constant rate y that, when used to discount all the bond’s promised cash flows (coupons and principal), equates their present value to the bond’s price. It is therefore a kind of average internal rate of return over the life of the bond, reflecting discounting at one flat rate instead of the full term structure of spot rates.\n\\n3) Forward rate for 4.75–5 years: The forward rate f(4.75,5) is the annualized interest rate, agreed today, for borrowing/lending during the future interval from 4.75 years to 5.0 years. Under no-arbitrage, it is implied by the spot discount factors (or spot rates) out to 4.75 and 5 years: it is the single rate over that short future period that makes rolling investment to 4.75 and then at the forward rate to 5 equivalent to investing directly to 5 at the 5-year spot rate.\n\\n4) Qualitative relation under a downward-sloping curve: When the term structure is downward sloping, later-dated spot rates are lower than earlier ones, and the sequence of forward rates across time typically declines as maturity increases. A long-horizon yield to maturity (e.g., a 5-year yield) on a coupon bond is a weighted average of discount rates over 0–5 years. In a downward-sloping curve, that average will generally lie between the higher short-term rates (near today) and the lower long-term/terminal rates (e.g., forward rates close to year 5). Thus, terminal forward rates near the end of the horizon (like the 4.75–5 year forward) will usually be lower than the earlier short rates and can be below the multi-year average yield represented by the bond’s YTM."

The project includes an initial $1,900,000 investment in threading equipment, lasts for five years, and involves annual fixed costs of $450,000 and variable costs of $210 per ton. The investment will be depreciated straight-line to zero over five years, with a salvage value of $500,000. Selling price is estimated at $245 per ton, with an initial net working capital investment of $450,000. A 13 percent return is required, facing a marginal tax rate of 38 percent.What is the best-case operating cash flow (OCF) for this project? (Unit: dollar)\n",

Thus EBIT (S8) = 11,025,000 − 9,900,000 − 380,000 = 850,000. Taxes at 38% (S9) = 0.38 × 850,000 = 323,000. After-tax EBIT (S10) = 850,000 − 323,000 = 527,000. Operating cash flow (S11) = after-tax EBIT + depreciation = 527,000 + 380,000 = 907,000? This conflicts with a recomputation: using the standard OCF formula OCF = (Sales − Costs) × (1 − T) + Depreciation × T, where Sales − Costs = 11,025,000 − (9,900,000 + 380,000) = 745,000, we get OCF = 745,000 × 0.62 + 380,000 × 0.38 = 461,900 + 144,?
