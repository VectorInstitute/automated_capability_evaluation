In the context of credit default swaps, there is a standard approximation formula that relates the CDS spread ($s$), the hazard rate ($\\lambda$), and the recovery rate ($R$). The formula is:\n$$s = \\lambda \\times (1 - R)$$\n\nThis relationship implies that the spread paid for protection is equal to the expected loss rate (hazard rate times loss given default). While the provided tables illustrate a detailed discrete calculation for a specific case (hazard rate of 2%, risk-free rate of approx. 5%), the question asks to solve for the hazard rate in a *new* scenario where the spread is defined as 100 basis points and the recovery rate is 20%.\n\n1.  **Identify the parameters:**\n    *   CDS Spread ($s$) = 100 basis points = $0.01$.\n    *   Recovery Rate ($R$) = 20% = $0.20$.\n\n2.  **Rearrange the formula to solve for the hazard rate ($\\lambda$):**\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{s}{1 - R} $$\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{0.01}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.01}{0.80} = 0.0125 $$\n\n4.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    $0.0125 \\times 100\\% = 1.25\\%$\n\nThe inclusion of the \"accrual payment\" calculation in the provided tables supports the use of this approximation, as the accrual adjustment makes the discrete premium payments functionally equivalent to the continuous payments assumed in the formula.\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The hazard rate (lambda) is estimated using the standard approximation formula s = lambda * (1 - R), where 's' is the CDS spread and 'R' is the recovery rate.

However, transaction costs ($F$) for buying/selling bonds remain. To minimize total costs, a rational individual would avoid transaction costs entirely by not purchasing bonds at all.\n3.  **Resulting Behavior:** The individual withdraws or holds their entire monthly income ($Y$) as cash at the beginning of the month ($t=0$).\n4.  **Average Calculation:** Assuming the individual spends this income at a uniform rate throughout the month, their money balance starts at $Y$ and ends at $0$.

In this model, this is the maximum possible average holding for transaction purposes (occurring when $i$ is low/zero). The holdings would generally be *less* than one-half if interest rates were positive (causing the individual to hold bonds and make multiple transactions).

The option is worth more \"alive\" (held) than \"dead\" (exercised).\n2.  **Components of Value**: The value of holding the option comes from two main sources:\n    *   **Time Value of Money**: By delaying exercise, the holder delays paying the strike price ($K$), earning interest on that money.\n    *   **Insurance Value (Volatility)**: The option gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy.

This eliminates the \"Time Value of Money\" benefit. However, it states that early exercise is still not optimal (or implies we need the reason why holding is preferred).\n4.  **The Remaining Factor**: Even with zero interest rates, the **insurance value** remains.

      "reasoning": "A downward-sloping term structure of interest rates implies that spot rates decrease as the time to maturity increases. In this environment, two key inequalities hold: 1) The instantaneous forward rate curve lies below the spot rate curve (marginal rate < average rate), meaning the forward rate corresponding to the period between 4.75 and 5 years is lower than the 5-year spot rate. 2) The yield to maturity on a coupon-bearing bond is a weighted average of the spot rates used to discount its cash flows. Since the spot rates for earlier coupon payments (short-term rates) are higher than the spot rate at maturity (long-term rate) in a downward-sloping environment, the resulting yield to maturity is higher than the spot rate at maturity. Combining these relationships, the yield on the five-year coupon-bearing bond is greater than the 5-year spot rate, which in turn is greater than the forward rate.

Option A is incorrect because nominal interest rates reached their historical peaks (highest values), not lowest, around 1980-1981 due to high inflation and the Volcker disinflation.\n2.

Option C is correct. The figure typically shows that nominal and real rates do not move in perfect lockstep due to fluctuating inflation. For example, in the late 1970s, nominal rates were high, but real rates were low or negative.
