The bond pays 8% coupon annually, so assuming face value of $100, the annual coupon is $8. At maturity (year 5), the bondholder also receives the face value of $100. Using continuous compounding, the present value formula is PV = CF \u00d7 e^(-r\u00d7t). For each cash flow: Year 1: $8 \u00d7 e^(-0.108\u00d71) = $8 \u00d7 0.8976 = $7.181, Year 2: $8 \u00d7 e^(-0.108\u00d72) = $8 \u00d7 0.8057 = $6.446, Year 3: $8 \u00d7 e^(-0.108\u00d73) = $8 \u00d7 0.7232 = $5.786, Year 4: $8 \u00d7 e^(-0.108\u00d74) = $8 \u00d7 0.6492 = $5.194, Year 5: $108 \u00d7 e^(-0.108\u00d75) = $108 \u00d7 0.5827 = $62.932. Total bond price = 7.181 + 6.446 + 5.786 + 5.194 + 62.932 = 87.54",

However, since we're not given specific best-case assumptions, I'll calculate the base case OCF first. Annual Revenue = 45,000 tons \u00d7 $245/ton = $11,025,000. Variable Costs = 45,000 tons \u00d7 $210/ton = $9,450,000. Fixed Costs = $450,000. Depreciation = $1,900,000 / 5 = $380,000. EBIT = Revenue - Variable Costs - Fixed Costs - Depreciation = $11,025,000 - $9,450,000 - $450,000 - $380,000 = $745,000. Taxes = $745,000 \u00d7 0.38 = $283,100.

For best-case, typically we assume 10% higher selling price and 10% lower variable costs. Best-case selling price = $245 \u00d7 1.10 = $269.50. Best-case variable cost = $210 \u00d7 0.90 = $189. Best-case Revenue = 45,000 \u00d7 $269.50 = $12,127,500. Best-case Variable Costs = 45,000 \u00d7 $189 = $8,505,000. EBIT = $12,127,500 - $8,505,000 - $450,000 - $380,000 = $2,792,500.

Next, with a 15% increase in sales, new sales = $32,000 \u00d7 1.15 = $36,800. Since costs and taxes maintain the same relationship to sales, I need to calculate the new net income. Cost ratio = $12,900 / $32,000 = 40.31%. New costs = $36,800 \u00d7 0.4031 = $14,835. New taxable income = $36,800 - $14,835 = $21,965. New taxes (34%) = $21,965 \u00d7 0.34 = $7,468.10.
