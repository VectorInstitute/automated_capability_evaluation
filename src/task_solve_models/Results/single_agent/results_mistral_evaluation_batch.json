Analyze the company's risk appetite and expected currency fluctuations over the next three months. If there are strong indicators of a stronger euro or weaker dollar, a call option may be advantageous.\n2. Determine the strike price for the call option, which typically is chosen by the company based on their assessment of the future exchange rate, with the goal of minimizing costs while ensuring adequate protection. Let's assume a suitable strike price has been decided upon as S in USD/euro.\n3. Calculate the premium paid (P) for the call option - this is a cost and will depend on various factors such as volatility, interest rates, liquidity, time to expiry, etc. A common method for estimating the premium is using Black-Scholes model or another popular pricing model.\n4. Compare the total cost of buying the call option (S + P) with the potential savings if the exchange rate turns out higher than the current one.

Since we don't have the market return (ER_m), we'll assume it as a proxy using the expected market return given by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which is ER_m = w_m * Risk-free rate + (1 - w_m) * Beta. Solving for Beta in this new equation gives us: Beta = (ER_m - ER_f) / (Risk-free rate - ER_f). Given that ER_r is 17%, ER_f is 5%, and the portfolio return ER_p is 8% with a risky asset beta of 1.30, we can use the first equation to find the weight of the risky asset (w_r = 0.2917) and then substitute w_r into the second equation to solve for Beta: Beta = (ER_m - ER_f) / (Risk-free rate - ER_f). However, since we don't know ER_m yet, we can't calculate the exact Beta value. Instead, we can estimate ER_m using the market risk premium (MRP = ER_m - ER_f), given that MRP is usually around 10% for a developed market like the United States. Using this approximation, we get an estimated ER_m of approximately 15%. Substituting ER_r = 17%, ER_f = 5%, ER_m \u2248 15%, and w_r \u2248 0.2917 into the first equation gives us w_m \u2248 0.4167 for the weight of the market index in the portfolio.

To find the forward interest rate in an FRA (Floating Rate Note) for the period between 5.1 and 5.35 years, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, convert the futures quote (97.1) to the expected short-term interest rate using the formula: Expected average Federal Funds Rate = (100 - Futures Quote) / (6 * Number of Quotation Bins), where Number of Quotation Bins depends on the contract's maturity division into discrete time intervals. In this case, it is likely 4 quarters a year (3 months each) for Eurodollar futures, so the number of quotation bins is 4. However, since the quoted period lies between 5.1 and 5.35 years, with 20 quarters in approximately 5.33 years, let's use that as an approximation for this problem. The expected average Federal Funds Rate would be:\n   Expected Average Fed Funds Rate = (100 - 97.1) / (6 * 20) = 0.00485 or 0.485% as a decimal value.\n2. Now, let's use the FRA-OIS (Overnight Indexed Swap) interpolated forward rate calculation. We know that the standard deviation of the change in the short-term interest rate in one year is 1.4%. We assume that the risk-neutral distribution for overnight rates follows a normal distribution and use Black's approximation to find the forward rate:\n   a. Calculate z, the z-score corresponding to the probability P(r > FRA Rate) = 0.5, assuming a bimodal normal distribution for overnight rates (the assumption is due to Eurodollar futures being quoted as a discrete average over several years). The z-score can be found through various means such as finding cumulative distribution functions in statistical tables or using z-table software like Z-Table by Brainbench.\n   b. Based on the 1.4% standard deviation, apply Black's approximation formula: FRA Rate = (FRA Rate at maturity + Risk-Free Rate) * erfc( z / sqrt( years ) ), where erfc(x) is the error function complement and reflects the probability of the overnight rate being above the forward rate.\n   c.
