We will first calculate the net income and then add back non-cash items and subtract changes in working capital.\r\n\r\n1. Calculate the net income: The only adjustment needed is to add back the depreciation expense, since this is a non-cash item. Therefore, net income equals income from continuing operations minus interest expense minus dividends paid plus depreciation minus taxes on income.\r\nIncome from continuing operations = Sales - Cost of goods sold - Depreciation expense - Interest expense - Taxes on income = $15,200 - $11,400 - $2,700 - $520 - ($15,200 * 34%) = $3,580\r\nNet income = Income from continuing operations + Interest expense - Dividends paid + Depreciation - Taxes on income = $3,580 + $520 - $600 + $2,700 - ($15,200 * 34%) = $11,280.\r\n\r\n2. Add back non-cash items: We add back the depreciation expense to get net cash provided by operating activities.\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities = Net income + Depreciation = $11,280 + $2,700 = $13,980.\r\n\r\n3. Subtract changes in working capital: To arrive at the final answer, we must subtract the increase in current liabilities minus the increase in current assets. This change is equal to $3,850 - $1,800 - ($2,100 - $1,800).\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities = $13,980 - (3,850 - 1,800 + 3300) = $13,980 - 2500 = $11,480",
