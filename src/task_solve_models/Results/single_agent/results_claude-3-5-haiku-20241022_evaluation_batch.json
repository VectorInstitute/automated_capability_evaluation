A positive NPV of $2,500 indicates that the project is expected to create value for shareholders. Specifically:\n    1. An NPV of $2,500 means the project will generate additional wealth for shareholders beyond their required rate of return.\n    2. If NPV is positive, the project should be accepted as it increases the firm's total shareholder value.\n    3. Option A is incorrect because rejecting the project would not increase revenues.\n    4.
