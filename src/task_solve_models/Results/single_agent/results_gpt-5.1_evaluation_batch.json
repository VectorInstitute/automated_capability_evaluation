Since they are priced at par, their yield to maturity initially equals the coupon rate, i.e., 8% nominal or 4% per half-year. After a 2% rise in interest rates, the new nominal yield is 10%, or 5% per half-year. For Bond Dave (15 years to maturity), there are 30 semiannual periods. Let par = 100. The old price at 4% per period is 100 by definition (priced at par). The new price is the present value of coupons and principal discounted at 5% per period: Price_new = 4 * [1 - (1.05)^(-30)] / 0.05 + 100 * (1.05)^(-30). First compute (1.05)^30 \u2248 4.3219, so (1.05)^(-30) \u2248 1 / 4.3219 \u2248 0.2314. Then the annuity factor at 5% for 30 periods is [1 - 0.2314] / 0.05 = 0.7686 / 0.05 = 15.372. Hence the PV of coupons is 4 * 15.372 = 61.488, and the PV of principal is 100 * 0.2314 = 23.14. So Price_new \u2248 61.488 + 23.14 = 84.628. The percentage change in price is (84.628 - 100) / 100 = -0.15372, or about -15.37%. Rounded appropriately, the percentage change in the price of Bond Dave is approximately -15.37.",

Conversely, low liquidity may increase expected returns because more funds are invested in higher-yield projects or assets, but it also raises the risk that the firm cannot meet short-term obligations, which can lead to costly emergency financing, loss of creditworthiness, or even insolvency. Therefore, there is a clear trade-off between safety (liquidity) and profitability, and it is indeed a central responsibility of the firm's financial management staff to determine and maintain an optimal or reasonable compromise between too much and too little liquidity, balancing risk and return.",

So a decrease in the risk-free rate tends to increase the attractiveness of early exercise.\n\n(B) An increase in the value of the insurance element: The insurance element reflects the protection the option provides against unfavorable future price movements. If this insurance value increases, the holder benefits more from keeping the option alive rather than exercising early. So this makes early exercise less attractive.\n\n(C) A decrease in market volatility: Lower volatility reduces the potential for future favorable price movements for the put (i.e., larger drops in the underlying). This reduces the time value of the option and makes it more attractive to exercise early if it is already in the money. That said, among the given conceptual choices, textbooks typically emphasize that lower volatility increases early exercise incentives, but the more direct and standard exam-style linkage for American puts is that lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of delaying the strike receipt, making early exercise more attractive.\n\nBetween the options, the clean and unambiguous driver that clearly makes early exercise more attractive is a decrease in the risk-free rate, because it directly lowers the benefit of deferring exercise.

On a standard money market diagram with interest rate on the vertical axis and quantity of money on the horizontal axis, a rightward shift in money demand leads to a new equilibrium with a higher interest rate and the same money supply. Typically, in such diagrams, the original equilibrium point O lies where the original money demand curve intersects the vertical money supply line. After income rises and money demand shifts right, the new equilibrium is shown as the point above O on the same vertical money supply line. In standard textbook illustrations, that point is labeled B. Therefore, the original equilibrium O moves to point B when income increases.",

      "reasoning": "1) Identify given data: Coupon rate = 8% annually on face value (assume FV = 1000), so annual coupon C = 0.08 * 1000 = 80. Purchase price P0 = 1105. Time to maturity at purchase = 10 years. Investor sells after 2 years, so at sale time there are 8 years remaining to maturity. After 2 years, YTM decreases by 1 percentage point from the original YTM. 2) Find original YTM (y0) by solving for y in the bond pricing equation: 1105 = 80 * [1 - (1 + y)^(-10)]/y + 1000 * (1 + y)^(-10). Solve numerically. Testing around 6%: At 6%, price \u2248 80 * (1 - 1/1.790847)/0.06 + 1000/1.790847 \u2248 80 * 13.7642 + 558.39 \u2248 162.11 + 558.39 \u2248 1104.6, very close to 1105. So y0 \u2248 6%. 3) After 2 years, YTM = y1 = y0 - 1% \u2248 5%. Remaining maturity then is 8 years. 4) Compute bond price at t=2 with YTM = 5% and 8 years left: P2 = 80 * [1 - (1.05)^(-8)]/0.05 + 1000 * (1.05)^(-8). First, (1.05)^8 \u2248 1.477455, so (1.05)^(-8) \u2248 0.67684. The annuity factor = [1 - 0.67684]/0.05 = 0.32316/0.05 = 6.4632. Thus coupon PV \u2248 80 * 6.4632 = 517.06. Principal PV \u2248 1000 * 0.67684 = 676.84. So P2 \u2248 517.06 + 676.84 = 1193.90. 5) Cash flows over the 2-year holding period: at t=1: +80; at t=2: +80 coupon + 1193.90 sale price = 1273.90. Initial outflow at t=0: -1105. 6) Compute holding period yield (HPY), the annual IRR over 2 years: Solve 1105 = 80/(1 + r) + 1273.90/(1 + r)^2. Let (1 + r) = x. Then 1105 x^2 = 80 x + 1273.90 \u2192 1105 x^2 - 80 x - 1273.90 = 0. Solve quadratic: Discriminant D = 80^2 + 4 * 1105 * 1273.90 \u2248 6400 + 5,630,? \u2248 5,637,? (more exactly: 4*1105*1273.9 \u2248 5,633,?; full D \u2248 5,639,? giving sqrt(D) \u2248 2375\u20132376). Approximating numerically instead is clearer: try r guesses. At r = 8%: PV = 80/1.08 + 1273.90/(1.08^2) \u2248 74.07 + 1092.47 = 1166.54 (>1105). At r = 10%: PV = 80/1.10 + 1273.90/(1.10^2) \u2248 72.73 + 1051.95 = 1124.68 (>1105). At r = 11%: PV \u2248 72.07 + 1033.26 = 1105.33 (very close). So HPY \u2248 11% per year. 7) Therefore the holding period yield over the 2-year horizon is approximately 11 percent annually.",

      "reasoning": "Without seeing the exact figure, one must rely on standard historical relationships between nominal and real interest rates. Around 1980, nominal interest rates in many economies (e.g., the U.S.) were actually very high due to high inflation and tight monetary policy, so it is unlikely both nominal and real interest rates reached their lowest values then, eliminating A. Nominal interest rates are rarely negative in long historical plots; instead, real interest rates can become negative when inflation exceeds nominal rates, so B (nominal sometimes negative while real always positive) is generally false. In many historical periods, especially during high inflation, nominal rates can be high while real rates are low or negative, showing that nominal interest rates can give a misleading picture of the true (inflation-adjusted) cost of borrowing or return on saving. Thus, the relationship most consistent with such a figure is that nominal interest rates are a misleading indicator of the real interest rate.",
