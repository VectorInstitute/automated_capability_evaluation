      "reasoning": "The first statement is correct in its premise. Bank chartering is a regulatory process where authorities (like the OCC or state banking commissions) screen proposals for new banks. A major goal of this screening is to prevent individuals who are likely to take excessive risks or engage in fraudulent activities from owning or controlling a bank. This directly addresses the adverse selection problem created by deposit insurance. Deposit insurance can attract risk-prone individuals because they know depositors won't flee if the bank takes big risks, as their money is protected. The chartering process acts as a gatekeeper to try and weed out these undesirable applicants. However, the second statement makes the entire proposition false. It uses the absolute terms 'guarantees' and 'never'. No regulatory process is perfect or can provide an absolute guarantee. Despite the chartering process, risk-prone entrepreneurs and even criminals have historically managed to gain control of banks, leading to bank failures. The process reduces the probability of such outcomes but does not eliminate it entirely. Therefore, because the regulation does not 'guarantee' this outcome, the statement as a whole is false.",

      "reasoning": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  First, let's define the key concept: Asymmetric information. In financial markets, this refers to a situation where one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other party. This imbalance can lead to market inefficiencies and problems like adverse selection and moral hazard.\n2.  Now, let's apply this concept to Credit Default Swaps (CDS). The critical piece of information in a CDS transaction is the true probability of default of the underlying company (the reference entity).\n3.  Let's analyze option A: \"The value of credit default swaps is independent of the creditworthiness of the underlying company.\" This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The value of a CDS is directly and entirely dependent on the perceived creditworthiness of the underlying entity. A higher perceived risk of default leads to a higher cost of protection (a wider CDS spread). Therefore, this option is false.\n4.  Let's analyze option C: \"Credit default swaps are always settled in foreign currencies.\" This statement is also incorrect. CDS contracts are typically denominated and settled in the currency of the underlying debt instrument. For a US company's bond, the CDS would be in US dollars. The currency of settlement does not create an asymmetric information problem regarding default risk.\n5.  Let's analyze option B: \"Some market participants may have more information about the likelihood of a company defaulting than others.\" This statement accurately describes the asymmetric information problem in the CDS market. For instance, a hedge fund that has conducted deep, proprietary research, or a large lender with access to a company's private financial data, may have a much better understanding of the company's true financial health than a more distant counterparty selling CDS protection. This informed party can use its superior knowledge to buy protection just before a company's troubles become public, profiting at the expense of the less-informed seller. This is the classic definition of an asymmetric information problem.",

      "reasoning": "1. The question asks for the reason a bank would adjust the discount rate used for currency swap cash flows away from a simple benchmark like LIBOR.\n2. The introductory sentence provides a significant clue: \"macroeconomic effects can cause spreads in floating-for-floating currency swaps, leading financial institutions to adjust the discount rates they use.\"\n3. This refers to the concept of the cross-currency basis spread. In a perfectly integrated and frictionless market, the interest rate implied by a currency swap should equal the market interest rate for that currency. However, in reality, a spread exists. \n4. This basis spread is driven by various macroeconomic factors, including differences in credit risk between banking systems, imbalances in supply and demand for a particular currency (e.g., a global 'shortage' of USD funding), and divergent central bank policies.\n5. To accurately value a currency swap and manage its risk, a bank must account for this basis spread. This is done by using different discount curves for the two currencies involved. For example, one might discount the USD leg using a USD OIS curve and the EUR leg using a EUR OIS curve adjusted for the EUR/USD basis spread. This process results in using discount rates that are different from the floating reference rates (like LIBOR or its successors) of the swap's legs.\n6. Choice A directly addresses this point. The adjustment to the discount rate is made specifically to incorporate the spreads that arise from macroeconomic effects.\n7. Choice B is incorrect because the primary goal of valuation is accuracy and risk management. Arbitrarily changing the discount rate to increase apparent profitability would misrepresent the swap's true value and risk, leading to poor decision-making.\n8. Choice C is a secondary reason. While regulations (like IFRS 13 or ASC 820 on fair value) require marking-to-market using observable inputs, and the basis spread is an observable market input, the fundamental *economic* reason for the adjustment is the existence of the spread itself, as described in Choice A.

In contrast, U.S. corporate democracy operates on the principle of 'one share, one vote.' This means a shareholder's voting power is directly proportional to the number of shares they own. An individual or entity that owns 1,000 shares of a company's stock has 1,000 votes in corporate elections (such as electing the board of directors), while a person who owns only one share has just one vote. Therefore, it is common for a single shareholder to have significantly more than one vote.",
