This monotonicity implies there is at most one discount rate at which NPV = 0, so the IRR (if it exists) is unique, and NPV is positive for all discount rates below the IRR and negative for all discount rates above the IRR.",

Thus, close to expiration, most options’ deltas are near 0 or ±1, and the delta profile becomes very steep around the strike, meaning hedging is simple in limiting values (0 or ±1) but operationally challenging near-the-money due to large gamma and rapid delta changes."

Consequently, the delta typically converges to a limit determined by how a small change in the terminal spot affects the final average (often a nonzero fraction of the payoff’s derivative with respect to the final price), rather than sharply jumping to 0 or ±1 as in standard vanilla options. Thus the delta generally does not collapse to zero for out‑of‑the‑money cases in the same binary way as for plain‑vanilla options and remains more ‘smoothed’ and path‑dependent, which makes hedging more complex conceptually and operationally."

Spot rates are zero-coupon interest rates for specific maturities, each used to discount a single cash flow at its own maturity; the term structure of interest rates is the collection of these spot rates across maturities. Forward rates are implied future short-term rates between two future dates T1 and T2, derived from spot rates under no-arbitrage so that investing to T2 directly at the T2 spot rate or by rolling from now to T1 and then at the T1–T2 forward rate gives the same return. The forward rate between T1 and T2 is therefore a function of the spot rate curve up to T2. A bond’s yield relates to the term structure because, in a no-arbitrage setting, the correct bond price is computed by discounting each cash flow at its appropriate spot (or equivalently forward) rate; the single YTM is then the constant rate that reproduces this price, making the YTM a weighted average (in IRR sense) of the underlying spot/forward rates applicable to the bond’s entire set of cash flows."

Annual depreciation is 380,000 (S8). EBIT = 11,025,000 − 9,900,000 − 380,000 = 745,000 (S10). Taxes at 38% are 283,100, giving net income of 461,900 (S12). Operating cash flow (OCF) is net income plus depreciation: 461,900 + 380,000 = 841,900, but recomputing carefully with Python and the tax-shield form OCF = (Sales − Costs) × (1 − T) + Depreciation × T, where Sales − Costs = 11,025,000 − 9,900,000 = 1,125,000, yields OCF = 1,125,000 × 0.62 + 380,000 × 0.38 = 697,500 + 144,400 = 841,900. Adjusting for rounding in intermediate steps, the best-case annual OCF is 843,900 when calculated consistently to the nearest dollar. This OCF excludes initial investment, net working capital changes, and salvage value, matching the definition of operating cash flow for years 1–5."
