      "reasoning": "Moral hazard is a type of post-contractual information asymmetry problem. It arises specifically because one party (the borrower) can take actions that are unobservable to the other party (the lender) after a transaction has been completed. For example, a borrower might take on excessive risk with a loan because they receive all the upside, while the lender bears the downside of default. The core of the problem is the lender's inability to perfectly monitor the borrower's actions. In the hypothetical scenario where there is no information asymmetry, the lender would have perfect and complete information about the borrower's actions at all times. This perfect monitoring capability would eliminate the 'hidden action' problem. If the borrower attempted to engage in overly risky behavior, the lender would know immediately and could enforce the terms of the contract (e.g., by calling the loan). Knowing they are being perfectly observed, the borrower would have no incentive or ability to act against the lender's interests. Therefore, eliminating information asymmetry directly eliminates the root cause of moral hazard.",

      "reasoning": "This question can be answered by applying the principle of put-call parity. The put-call parity theorem states a relationship between the price of a European call option (C), a European put option (P), the underlying stock price (S), and the present value of the strike price (K). The formula is:\n\nC + PV(K) = P + S\n\nWhere PV(K) is the present value of the strike price K, discounted from the expiration date. This represents a risk-free, zero-coupon bond that pays K at expiration, which is equivalent to holding a certain amount of cash today that will grow to K.\n\nThe problem asks for the position equivalent to a 'protective put'. A protective put is defined as a long position in the underlying shares (S) combined with a long position in a put option (P). In the put-call parity formula, this corresponds to the right-hand side of the equation: P + S.\n\nAccording to the parity relationship, the portfolio P + S is equivalent to the portfolio on the left-hand side of the equation: C + PV(K).\n\nLet's break down the components of C + PV(K):\n- C represents a long position in a call option.\n- PV(K) represents a long position in a risk-free bond, which is equivalent to holding a 'certain amount of cash'.\n\nTherefore, a protective put (Long Stock + Long Put) is equivalent to a long position in a call option plus a certain amount of cash. This combination is also known as a 'fiduciary call'.\n\nComparing this to the choices:\nA. A short position in a call option is incorrect.\nB. Minus a certain amount of shares is incorrect.\nC.

An earnings announcement provides new information that causes market participants (investors, analysts) to update these expectations. When a company announces unexpectedly low earnings, it serves as a negative signal about the company's current performance and future prospects. This new, negative information leads market participants to revise their financial models. They will lower their forecasts for the company's future growth rates and its ability to generate cash flows. A reduction in expected future cash flows and/or growth rates, when discounted to the present, results in a lower intrinsic valuation for the company. This reduced valuation leads to a decrease in the share price. Option B is incorrect because unexpectedly low earnings would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in valuation. Option C is incorrect because while a company might issue shares to raise capital, this is a separate corporate finance decision and not a direct market reaction to the earnings announcement itself.

In a primitive, non-specialized economy, each economic unit (like a family or a small tribe) is largely self-sufficient. They hunt, gather, and create most of what they consume. Because there is little to no division of labor or specialization, the volume of goods that need to be exchanged is very low. Trade, if it occurs, is typically limited to simple barter. Money evolves as a solution to the problems of barter, most notably the 'double coincidence of wants,' which becomes a significant obstacle as trade becomes more frequent and complex. This complexity arises directly from specialization, where individuals produce a surplus of one good and need to trade for all other goods they require. Since caveman economies lacked this specialization, the need for extensive trade was minimal, and therefore, the need for money as a medium of exchange had not yet developed.

This feature is valuable to investors who are in high tax brackets, as it can result in a higher after-tax yield compared to a taxable bond. Because of this tax advantage, municipal bonds offer a lower pre-tax yield than comparable taxable bonds (like corporate bonds). The Phew Charitable Trust is a tax-exempt entity, meaning it does not pay taxes on its investment income. For an entity that already pays no taxes, the tax-exempt feature of a municipal bond is redundant and provides no value. The Trust would be accepting a lower yield for a tax benefit it does not need. A rational, tax-exempt investor would choose a higher-yielding taxable bond over a lower-yielding tax-exempt municipal bond, assuming similar credit quality and maturity. Therefore, it would be irrational for the trust to hold municipal bonds specifically for their tax benefits.",

      "reasoning": "A total return swap (TRS) is a financial derivative where one party transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset to another party. Let's analyze the two statements. \n1. 'A total return swap can be used as a financing tool.' This statement is correct. A company can use a TRS to gain exposure to an asset without having to purchase it outright. The company (the total return receiver) pays a funding leg (e.g., a floating rate like SOFR + spread) to a financial institution (the total return payer). In return, the financial institution pays the company the total return of the reference asset. This is economically similar to the company borrowing money from the institution to buy the asset, hence it functions as a form of synthetic financing or leverage.\n2. 'In the event of a default by the company, the financial institution does not own the assets.' This statement is incorrect. In the structure described above, the financial institution (the total return payer) actually buys and holds the reference asset on its balance sheet. It is the legal owner of the asset. The TRS is a separate contract that transfers the economic exposure, not the legal title. If the company (the receiver) defaults on its payments, the swap contract would be terminated. However, the financial institution would still own the underlying asset, as it owned it all along. The institution's risk is the potential decline in the asset's value and the loss of the funding leg payments. Because this second statement is false, the overall proposition is false.",

In this swap, Company B will agree to pay a fixed interest rate to a swap dealer (a bank) and, in return, receive a floating interest rate (LIBOR) from the dealer.\n\n3.  **Find the Correct Swap Rate from the Table:** The table provides bid and offer rates from the perspective of a market maker (the swap dealer). \n    *   The **bid rate** is the fixed rate the dealer will pay to receive floating.\n    *   The **offer rate** (or ask rate) is the fixed rate the dealer will receive to pay floating.\n    Since Company B wants to pay fixed and receive floating, it will have to accept the dealer's offer rate. \n\n4.  **Identify the 5-Year Offer Rate:** Looking at the table for a 5-year maturity, the offer rate is 6.51%.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Cash Flows:**\n    *   **From the original loan:** Company B pays its lender `LIBOR + 0.75%`.\n    *   **From the swap:** \n        *   Company B pays the swap dealer a fixed rate of `6.51%`.\n        *   Company B receives the floating rate `LIBOR` from the swap dealer.\n\n6.  **Calculate the All-In Fixed Rate Cost:** The net cost for Company B is the sum of all its payments minus its receipts.\n    *   Net Cost = (Payment on loan) + (Fixed payment on swap) - (Floating receipt on swap)\n    *   Net Cost = (LIBOR + 0.75%) + 6.51% - LIBOR\n    *   The `LIBOR` terms cancel each other out.\n    *   Net Cost = 0.75% + 6.51% = 7.26%\n\nTherefore, Company B can swap its floating-rate loan into an effective fixed rate of 7.26%.
