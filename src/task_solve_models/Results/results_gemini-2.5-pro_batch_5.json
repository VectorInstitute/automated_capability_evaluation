The first part of the statement, \"Airlines offer an example of an industry in which the degree of operating leverage is fairly high,\" is correct. The airline industry is characterized by a high proportion of fixed costs (aircraft leases/depreciation, gate fees, maintenance facilities, staff salaries) relative to variable costs (fuel per passenger, in-flight service). This cost structure means that once the break-even point is covered, small changes in revenue lead to large changes in operating income, which is the definition of high operating leverage. However, the second part of the statement, which attempts to explain this, is completely false. It claims, \"Fixed costs are relatively low because airlines are not capital intensive, and airplanes are inexpensive.\" In reality, the airline industry is one of the most capital-intensive industries. Airplanes are extremely expensive assets, costing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each. Consequently, airlines have massive fixed costs. The high degree of operating leverage exists precisely *because* of these high fixed costs, not in spite of them. Since the reasoning provided in the statement is the exact opposite of the truth, the entire statement is false.",

The two means are equal only in the specific case where all the numbers in the set are identical. For any set of non-identical positive numbers, the arithmetic mean will always be strictly greater than the geometric mean.

Let `w_s` be the weight of the stock and `w_rf` be the weight of the risk-free asset. The formula is:\n    E(R_p) = (w_s * E(R_s)) + (w_rf * R_f)\n    Since the portfolio only contains these two assets, `w_s + w_rf = 1`, which means `w_rf = 1 - w_s`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the known values into the expected return formula and solve for `w_s`:**\n    0.08 = (w_s * 0.17) + ((1 - w_s) * 0.05)\n    0.08 = 0.17*w_s + 0.05 - 0.05*w_s\n    0.08 - 0.05 = 0.17*w_s - 0.05*w_s\n    0.03 = 0.12*w_s\n    w_s = 0.03 / 0.12\n    w_s = 0.25\n    So, the weight of the stock in the portfolio is 25%, and the weight of the risk-free asset is `1 - 0.25 = 0.75` or 75%.\n\n4.  **Calculate the portfolio beta (\u03b2_p).** The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average of the betas of its individual components:\n    \u03b2_p = (w_s * \u03b2_s) + (w_rf * \u03b2_rf)\n\n5.  **Substitute the calculated weights and given betas into the portfolio beta formula:**\n    \u03b2_p = (0.25 * 1.30) + (0.75 * 0)\n    \u03b2_p = 0.325 + 0\n    \u03b2_p = 0.325\n\nTherefore, the beta of the portfolio is 0.325.",

The reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Full Deposit Insurance:** If all deposits are fully insured, depositors have no incentive to monitor their bank's behavior or choose a bank based on its financial soundness. Their money is safe regardless of the bank's actions. This lack of market discipline allows banks to potentially engage in high-risk, high-reward activities. If the risks pay off, the bank profits. If the bank fails, the deposit insurance fund bears the cost of repaying depositors.\n2.  **Limited Deposit Insurance:** When deposit insurance is limited (e.g., by a coverage cap), large depositors with funds exceeding the cap are not fully protected. Their money is at risk if the bank fails.\n3.  **Market Discipline:** This exposure to risk incentivizes these large, uninsured depositors to monitor the bank's health and risk profile carefully. They will likely withdraw their funds from a bank they perceive as taking excessive risks. \n4.  **Impact on Bank Behavior:** The threat of losing large deposits forces the bank's management to be more prudent and conservative in its lending and investment decisions. This 'market discipline' from uninsured depositors discourages the bank from taking on excessive risks.\nTherefore, limiting deposit insurance helps reduce moral hazard by making banks accountable to their large depositors, which in turn discourages excessive risk-taking.",

However, the question asks if these measures can *completely* eliminate the problem.

Bankers have strong incentives to find ways around these regulations. This is known as regulatory arbitrage. They can develop new financial instruments that are difficult for regulators to assess, use creative accounting to hide risky assets in off-balance-sheet entities, or overstate the value of their capital to appear safer than they are. The complexity of modern finance and the constant drive for profit mean that regulators are always playing a game of catch-up.
