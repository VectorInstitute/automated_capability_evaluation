In such a scenario, targeting the interest rate might lead to undesirable outcomes because minor changes in the interest rate could lead to large swings in money supply. A money supply target becomes more useful because it focuses on stabilizing the actual amount of money in circulation, irrespective of its demand, which helps in controlling inflation and ensuring economic stability. Thus, a money supply target is preferred as it provides a more stable and predictable framework to manage monetary policy when the demand for money is unstable.",

The B-rated corporate bond, however, is likely to carry risks that are more correlated with broader economic cycles, making them less easily diversified.
