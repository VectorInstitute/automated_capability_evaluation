The prompt should use simple verbs such as identify, list, define, or select, and the answer should be directly retrievable from prior instruction (e.g., a standard definition, a key formula name, or a basic part-label mapping). Keep the context minimal and familiar—at most a short, unambiguous statement, diagram label, or example where the required knowledge is the only missing piece. Difficulty remains easy by avoiding distractors that require inference, avoiding novel settings, and ensuring there is a single correct response that can be produced quickly from memory.",

      "blueprint": "Design a comprehension-focused item that asks the learner to demonstrate understanding of a basic concept by explaining it in their own words, summarizing a short passage, or classifying a simple example into a known category. The task should require light interpretation (e.g., restating meaning, identifying the main idea, or matching an example to a definition) rather than recall alone, but it should not involve calculations, multi-step reasoning, or comparing multiple competing explanations. Provide a brief, familiar context—such as a one-sentence scenario, a short definition, or a single example—so the learner can describe what it represents or why it fits a category. Difficulty remains easy by keeping the information minimal and unambiguous, using common terminology from instruction, and ensuring the expected response is short (1–3 sentences or a single classification) with a clear, direct mapping to the taught concept.",
