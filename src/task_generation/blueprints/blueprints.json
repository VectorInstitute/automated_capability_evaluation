Provide a brief, familiar context—such as a one-sentence scenario, a short definition, or a single example—so the learner can describe what it represents or why it fits a category.

Provide all necessary information, but present it in a slightly less “plug-and-chug” form (e.g., a short scenario, a small table of values, or parameters that must be identified from the text) so the learner must extract and map inputs to the procedure.

The prompt should be structured so the learner must select relevant details and organize them (e.g., grouping cases by properties, mapping steps to rules used, or pinpointing where reasoning changes), rather than simply applying a known procedure.

Provide clear, limited constraints (e.g., include two specific ideas, satisfy three conditions, or use a given format) so creativity is bounded and success can be evaluated objectively.

The learner should demonstrate procedural fluency and strategic method selection: mapping a novel-but-still-familiar scenario into the right sequence of operations, keeping track of intermediate outputs, and checking that constraints or assumptions are satisfied at each stage. Provide enough structure so it is still an “apply” task (the relevant tools are taught), but embed the task in a less direct context—such as noisy or redundant information, a realistic scenario, or parameters that must be derived rather than given explicitly.
