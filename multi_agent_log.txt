Finally, solve for \( g_{1} \):

\[ g_{1} = \frac{0.075-0.003}{(0.000375) + 0.005} = \boxed{\textbf{14.1667}}\ \]

**Pitfalls and Required Conversions**

* Percentages to decimals: Each percentage (volatility, rate) has been converted to its decimal form (e.g., from 13% to 0.13).
* Time units: The six-month time frame is equivalent to T = 6/12 = 0.5 years.

**Conclusion**

The problem required a numerical calculation, and the final result \( \boxed{\textbf{14.1667}}
