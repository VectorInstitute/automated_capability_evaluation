This will help in obtaining the delta-hedge portfolio.\n   First, we find the forward-value discount factors for every time t from 0 to 3 and for the end-time T (1 year + 3 months - 30 days):\n         Fwd Discount Factor at Time t = Exp[-(T-t)/252*6.9395%] (continuously compounded rate)\n   So, our probability density function becomes:\n      p(t,T) = dFwd/dt\n\n3. Following this framework and also considering the risk-neutral log-normal distribution for the forward rates under the given caplet, \n   We will find the convexity adjustment.\n\n   Now let's do it!\n   First, we calculate \u2206fT as follows:\n         \u2206fT = (Fwd Discount Factor at Time 0 - Fwd Discount Factor at Time 3)/252\n\n   Next, we'll calculate \u03c3 and then \u03c1.\n      \u03c3 = 20/100 (per annum volatility)\n      \u03c1 = 1/cosh(\u03c3^2*(1 year + 3 months-30 days)^.5 )^(3*12)\n\n4. Finally, the convexity adjustment can be calculated with its unit:\n         Convexity Adjustment = exp(-\u03c1 * (\u2206fT)^2/2) - \u03c1 * (\u2206fT)\n   With these calculations, we will obtain the answer.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1766088059, "model": "llama3:latest", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ollama", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 635, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "prompt_tokens": 230, "completion_tokens": 405, "agent_id": null}
