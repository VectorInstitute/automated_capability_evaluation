2. **Computing Up and Down Factors:**
   - \( u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}} \)
   - \( d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}} \)

3. **Calculating Risk-neutral Probabilities:**
   - \( p = \frac{e^{r \Delta t} - d}{u - d} \)

4. **Constructing the Price Tree:**
   - Compute futures prices \( F_{i,j} = F_0 \times u^j \times d^{i-j} \)

5. **Calculating Payoffs at Maturity:**
   - At each final node: \( \text{Payoff} = \max(K - F_{3,j}
