# Legacy LBO Code

This directory contains legacy code for **Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO)** from an earlier version of the repository. LBO was used for intelligent capability selection during evaluation.

## Compatible Version

This LBO code is compatible with the repository at commit [`a224c5ec`](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/automated_capability_evaluation/tree/a224c5ec7dd208e04ef2edc059e6e7a2d0d4bcf6). That commit contains the full working version of the codebase used for the **initial paper submission**.

**This code does not work with the current codebase.** This was the base legacy code before the generation and evaluation pipelines were standardized. If you need to understand how LBO integrated with the rest of the system, refer to that version.
